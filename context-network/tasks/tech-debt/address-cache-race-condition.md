# Address Potential Cache Race Condition

## Context
During code review, a potential race condition was identified in the service discovery cache update mechanism.

## Current Implementation
Service information is cached in separate operations:
```rust
// In probe_service method:
{
    let mut services = self.services.write().await;
    services.insert(service_type, service_info.clone());
}
```

## Potential Issue
While individual HashMap operations are atomic, the sequence of:
1. Health check succeeds  
2. Create ServiceInfo
3. Insert into cache

Could potentially have race conditions if multiple probes happen simultaneously for the same service.

## Analysis Required
- [ ] Determine if the current RwLock usage provides sufficient protection
- [ ] Identify specific scenarios where races could occur
- [ ] Benchmark current performance to establish baseline
- [ ] Research if other concurrent data structures would be better

## Possible Solutions
1. **Keep current approach** - If analysis shows no real race risk
2. **Single atomic update** - Combine health check + cache update  
3. **Use different concurrent data structure** - Consider `DashMap` or similar
4. **Add explicit sequencing** - Ensure operations happen in order

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze and document potential race scenarios
- [ ] Determine if changes are needed based on actual risk
- [ ] If changes made, benchmark to ensure no performance regression
- [ ] Add specific tests for concurrent access if needed
- [ ] Document the thread safety guarantees

## Implementation Notes
- Current tests include concurrent access scenarios - use as baseline
- Consider the frequency of cache updates vs reads  
- Balance complexity vs real-world risk
- May be low priority if no actual issues identified

## Estimated Effort
45-60 minutes (including analysis time)

## Priority  
Medium - Potential reliability improvement, needs investigation
