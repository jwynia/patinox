# Lightweight Implementation Tracking System

## Task Overview
**Priority**: Low  
**Effort**: Medium (30-60 minutes)  
**Risk**: Low  
**Source**: Context Network Sync Report 2025-08-22

## Background
The sync report identified that implementation work sometimes gets ahead of documentation, creating drift between planned and actual states. A lightweight tracking system could help maintain alignment during active development phases.

## Problem Statement
**Current Challenges**:
- Implementation work proceeds faster than documentation updates
- Context network sync reveals completions that weren't tracked
- No intermediate visibility into in-progress implementations
- Gap between "planned" and "complete" with no "in-progress" visibility

**Impact**:
- Sync reports required to discover completed work
- Planning decisions made with incomplete information
- Coordination challenges when multiple people work on project

## Proposed Solution
Implement a lightweight tracking system that:
- Requires minimal overhead for developers
- Provides visibility into current implementation status
- Integrates with existing context network structure
- Supports sync process improvements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Tracking Features
- [ ] Simple status tracking for major implementation work
- [ ] Integration with context network structure
- [ ] Minimal overhead for updating status
- [ ] Clear visibility into current implementation state

### Implementation Options to Evaluate
- [ ] **Option 1**: Extend existing task files with status indicators
- [ ] **Option 2**: Create implementation status dashboard/index
- [ ] **Option 3**: Git-based tracking using branch/commit patterns
- [ ] **Option 4**: Simple status file with implementation markers

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] System is easy to maintain and update
- [ ] Provides value without being burdensome
- [ ] Integrates cleanly with sync process
- [ ] Supports both solo and team development

## Design Considerations

### Lightweight Requirements
- Updates should take < 30 seconds
- No complex tooling or dependencies  
- Readable by both humans and scripts
- Works with existing context network patterns

### Information to Track
- **Implementation Status**: Not started / In progress / Complete
- **Current Phase**: Planning / Foundation / Implementation / Testing
- **Blockers**: Any current obstacles or dependencies
- **Last Updated**: Simple timestamp for freshness

### Integration Points
- Context network sync process
- Planning documents and task tracking  
- Implementation records creation
- Regular development workflow

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Design and Prototype
1. Research existing patterns in context network
2. Design minimal tracking format and structure
3. Create prototype with one current implementation
4. Validate with sync process integration

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. Create tracking system structure
2. Integrate with existing context network organization
3. Document usage patterns and update procedures
4. Test with current local provider implementations

### Phase 3: Validation and Refinement
1. Use system for tracking new implementations
2. Measure overhead vs value provided
3. Refine based on actual usage patterns
4. Document lessons learned for future improvements

## Success Metrics
- Reduced gap between implementation and documentation
- Improved planning decisions with current state visibility
- Faster sync processes due to better tracking
- Developer adoption with minimal resistance

## Non-Goals
- Complex project management tooling
- Detailed time tracking or metrics
- Integration with external tools
- Replacement for existing planning processes

## Related Research
- Review how other projects handle implementation tracking
- Study context network patterns for status information
- Analyze sync report patterns for tracking opportunities
- Consider integration with existing development tools
