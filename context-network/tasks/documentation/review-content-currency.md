# Review Content Currency and Update Stale Documents

## Classification
- **Domain:** Documentation
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Task Summary
Review documents marked as "Dynamic" stability that haven't been updated recently and update stale discovery records to ensure content accuracy and currency.

## Original Recommendation
**From Context Network Audit 2025-09-18:**
"Review content currency → Ensure information accuracy → Maintain network value"

## Problem Description
The context network contains documents that may have become stale or outdated:

1. **Stale Discovery Records**: Some discovery records from early 2025 may need currency review
2. **Dynamic Documents**: Documents marked as "Dynamic" stability should be updated regularly but some haven't been
3. **Implementation Lag**: Content may not reflect current implementation progress
4. **Outdated References**: Links and references to superseded information

## Acceptance Criteria

### Discovery Records Review
- [ ] Audit all discovery records older than 3 months
- [ ] Verify technical findings against current codebase
- [ ] Update outdated methodology references
- [ ] Remove or archive superseded discoveries
- [ ] Add current date stamps to refreshed content

### Dynamic Document Audit
- [ ] Identify all documents with "Stability: Dynamic" classification
- [ ] Check last update dates against expected change frequency
- [ ] Review content accuracy against current project state
- [ ] Update stale dynamic content or reclassify stability level

### Implementation Alignment
- [ ] Compare documented architecture with actual implementation
- [ ] Update implementation status references
- [ ] Verify task completion status against actual work
- [ ] Refresh progress indicators and current priorities

### Reference Validation
- [ ] Check references to external resources for validity
- [ ] Update links to moved or renamed internal documents
- [ ] Verify technical specifications against current standards
- [ ] Remove references to deprecated tools or approaches

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Currency Assessment
1. Generate list of documents by last update date
2. Identify "Dynamic" stability documents
3. Map discovery records to current relevance
4. Assess implementation-related content accuracy

### Phase 2: Content Review
1. Review oldest discovery records first
2. Check dynamic documents against change expectations
3. Validate technical specifications against codebase
4. Identify content requiring updates vs archival

### Phase 3: Updates and Corrections
1. Update inaccurate technical information
2. Refresh stale discovery records with current findings
3. Archive superseded content appropriately
4. Add current timestamps and change history entries

### Phase 4: Maintenance Process
1. Document content review schedule
2. Add currency indicators to dynamic content
3. Create maintenance reminders for regular review
4. Update network maintenance procedures

## Specific Review Targets

### Discovery Records
- Discovery records from Q1 2025 (January-March)
- TDD and testing methodology discoveries
- Architecture pattern discoveries
- Implementation technique findings

### Dynamic Documents
- Planning backlogs and task lists
- Implementation status documents
- Technology evaluations
- Process refinements

### Implementation References
- Architecture decision outcomes
- Component implementation status
- Test coverage and quality metrics
- Development workflow descriptions

## Why Deferred
- **Effort**: Medium (requires content analysis and technical verification)
- **Risk**: Low (improves accuracy without breaking functionality)
- **Dependencies**: Local (needs understanding of current project state)
- **Complexity**: Requires judgment about content relevance and accuracy

## Estimated Effort
**Medium (45-75 minutes)**
- 20 minutes: Currency assessment and prioritization
- 30 minutes: Content review and accuracy checking
- 15 minutes: Updates and corrections
- 10 minutes: Maintenance process documentation

## Review Criteria

### Content Freshness
- Last updated within expected timeframe for stability level
- References current implementation state
- Uses current terminology and approaches
- Links to valid, accessible resources

### Technical Accuracy
- Specifications match current codebase
- Implementation status reflects actual progress
- Dependencies and interfaces are current
- Performance and quality metrics are up-to-date

### Relevance
- Content serves current project needs
- Discoveries inform current development
- Processes match current workflows
- Examples reflect current best practices

## Success Metrics
- All dynamic documents updated within appropriate timeframes
- Discovery records accurately reflect current understanding
- Technical specifications align with implementation
- Reduced references to outdated or superseded information
