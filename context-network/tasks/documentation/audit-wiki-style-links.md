# Audit and Fix Wiki-Style Links

## Classification
- **Domain:** Documentation
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Task Summary
Systematically audit all [[wiki-style links]] throughout the context network to identify broken references and either create missing targets or update links to valid destinations.

## Original Recommendation
**From Context Network Audit 2025-09-18:**
"Audit wiki-style links → Fix broken cross-references → Restore network integrity"

## Problem Description
The context network contains numerous wiki-style links (format: [[link-target]]) that reference non-existent documents, reducing navigation effectiveness and network integrity.

### Known Broken Links
From initial audit findings:
- `[[tower-validation-pipeline-implementation]]`
- `[[validation-tdd-methodology]]`
- `[[validator-sorting-optimization]]`
- `[[html-sanitization-upgrade]]`
- `[[groomed-backlog-2025-09-15]]`
- `[[Async Testing Best Practices]]`
- `[[Error-Driven Development]]`
- `[[Code Review Workflow]]`
- `[[Task Planning and Prioritization]]`
- `[[Risk Assessment Framework]]`

## Acceptance Criteria

### Link Audit
- [ ] Complete scan of all .md files for [[wiki-links]]
- [ ] Categorize links by type (implementations, methodologies, processes, tasks)
- [ ] Identify which links reference existing vs missing targets
- [ ] Document link frequency and importance

### Broken Link Resolution
- [ ] For high-priority missing targets: Create placeholder documents
- [ ] For implementation-specific links: Link to actual implementation files
- [ ] For methodology links: Link to existing process documents or create them
- [ ] For obsolete links: Update to current equivalent or remove

### Link Standardization
- [ ] Ensure consistent link formatting throughout network
- [ ] Standardize on file path vs wiki-link usage
- [ ] Update links to use actual file paths where appropriate
- [ ] Document wiki-link usage guidelines

## Technical Requirements

### Scanning and Cataloging
1. Comprehensive regex search for [[.*]] patterns
2. Extract all unique wiki-link targets
3. Check existence of referenced files
4. Map link usage frequency and context

### Resolution Strategy
1. **Create Missing Documents**: For frequently referenced, important concepts
2. **Update to File Paths**: For links that should reference existing files
3. **Merge Concepts**: For duplicate or similar link targets
4. **Remove Obsolete**: For links to deprecated or irrelevant concepts

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis
1. Scan entire context network for [[wiki-links]]
2. Create comprehensive inventory with usage context
3. Categorize by type and importance
4. Prioritize resolution based on frequency and navigation impact

### Phase 2: High-Priority Resolution
1. Create documents for most critical missing targets
2. Update links to existing documents where appropriate
3. Fix broken navigation paths in discovery records

### Phase 3: Systematic Cleanup
1. Resolve remaining broken links
2. Standardize link formatting
3. Update documentation guidelines
4. Add link validation to maintenance procedures

## Resolution Decisions

### Links to Create Documents For
- `[[validation-tdd-methodology]]` → Process document
- `[[Error-Driven Development]]` → Methodology document
- `[[Code Review Workflow]]` → Process document

### Links to Convert to File Paths
- `[[groomed-backlog-2025-09-15]]` → `../../planning/groomed_backlog_2025-09-15.md`
- Implementation-specific links → Actual src/ file references

### Links to Remove/Update
- Obsolete or superseded references
- Duplicate concepts with different names

## Why Deferred
- **Effort**: Medium (requires systematic investigation)
- **Risk**: Low-Medium (could break additional references during fixing)
- **Dependencies**: System (needs understanding of full network context)
- **Complexity**: Requires content analysis and editorial decisions

## Estimated Effort
**Medium (45-90 minutes)**
- 20 minutes: Complete link inventory
- 30 minutes: Analysis and categorization
- 25 minutes: High-priority link resolution
- 15 minutes: Documentation updates

## Tools Needed
- Grep/ripgrep for link scanning
- Script for automated link checking
- Decision matrix for resolution strategy

## Success Metrics
- Zero broken [[wiki-links]] in context network
- Improved navigation between related documents
- Clear guidelines for future wiki-link usage
- Enhanced network integrity and usability

## Related Work
- [Navigation Testing](create-navigation-testing-procedures.md) - Systematic navigation validation
- [Content Currency Review](review-content-currency.md) - Update stale references
- [Network Maintenance](../../meta/maintenance.md) - Ongoing link validation

## Priority
**High** - Broken links significantly impact network usability
