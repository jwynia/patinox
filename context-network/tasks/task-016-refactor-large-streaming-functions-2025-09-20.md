# Task-016: Refactor Large Stream Processing Functions

**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Large (2-3 hours)
**Type**: Refactoring / Maintainability

## Context

Code review identified that the stream processing functions in both providers are quite long (113-161 lines) and handle multiple concerns. These functions would benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused methods.

## Original Recommendation

> **Complex Function Length** (>110 lines)
> **File**: `src/provider/local/ollama.rs:405-518` (113 lines)
> **File**: `src/provider/local/lmstudio.rs:429-590` (161 lines)
> **Issue**: Stream processing functions are quite long and handle multiple concerns

## Problem

The `stream_completion` methods are complex and handle multiple responsibilities:
1. HTTP response stream setup
2. Byte-to-string conversion with buffering
3. Line-by-line parsing and validation
4. JSON deserialization and error handling
5. Chunk size validation
6. Usage calculation and chunk creation
7. Buffer cleanup for incomplete lines

This makes the functions harder to:
- Test individual components
- Understand and maintain
- Debug when issues occur
- Reuse validation and processing logic

## Solution

Break down into smaller, focused components:

```rust
async fn stream_completion(&self, request: CompletionRequest) -> ProviderResult<StreamingResponse> {
    // ... setup code ...
    let mut processor = StreamProcessor::new(model_id);
    processor.process_stream(response.bytes_stream()).await
}

struct StreamProcessor {
    model_id: ModelId,
    buffer: String,
    chunks: Vec<StreamingChunk>,
}

impl StreamProcessor {
    fn new(model_id: ModelId) -> Self { /* ... */ }

    async fn process_stream<S>(&mut self, stream: S) -> ProviderResult<StreamingResponse>
    where S: futures_util::Stream<Item = Result<bytes::Bytes, reqwest::Error>> + Unpin
    {
        // Main stream processing loop
    }

    fn process_line(&mut self, line: &str) -> Result<bool, ProviderError> {
        // Process individual line, return true if should continue
    }

    fn process_remaining_buffer(&mut self) -> Result<(), ProviderError> {
        // Handle remaining buffer content
    }

    fn parse_and_validate_response(&self, data: &str) -> Result<OllamaGenerateResponse, ProviderError> {
        // JSON parsing with validation
    }

    fn create_chunk_from_response(&self, response: OllamaGenerateResponse) -> Result<Option<StreamingChunk>, ProviderError> {
        // Convert response to chunk with all validation
    }
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Break `stream_completion` into smaller focused methods (<50 lines each)
- [ ] Create `StreamProcessor` struct for Ollama provider
- [ ] Create `StreamProcessor` struct for LMStudio provider (similar but SSE-specific)
- [ ] Each method has single responsibility
- [ ] Maintain identical public API behavior
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual processor methods
- [ ] Improve error context and debugging information

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Ollama Refactoring
1. Extract `StreamProcessor` struct
2. Move line processing logic to `process_line()`
3. Move buffer cleanup to `process_remaining_buffer()`
4. Move JSON parsing/validation to helper methods
5. Test thoroughly

### Phase 2: LMStudio Refactoring
1. Create similar `StreamProcessor` for SSE format
2. Handle SSE-specific parsing differences
3. Maintain same interface where possible
4. Test thoroughly

### Phase 3: Common Abstractions
1. Identify shared patterns between processors
2. Consider trait-based approach for common functionality
3. Extract shared validation and error handling

## Files to Modify

### Core Implementation
- `src/provider/local/ollama.rs` - Refactor stream_completion method
- `src/provider/local/lmstudio.rs` - Refactor stream_completion method

### New Modules (Optional)
- `src/provider/local/stream_processor.rs` - Common stream processing utilities
- `src/provider/local/ollama/stream_processor.rs` - Ollama-specific processor
- `src/provider/local/lmstudio/stream_processor.rs` - LMStudio-specific processor

### Testing
- Add unit tests for new processor methods
- Integration tests for end-to-end behavior

## Why Deferred

**Effort**: Large (requires careful design and extensive testing)
**Risk**: High (major refactoring of core streaming functionality)
**Dependencies**: System (affects core provider behavior)
**Rationale**: This is a significant architectural change that requires careful planning, design decisions about abstraction levels, and comprehensive testing to ensure no behavioral regressions.

## Priority Justification

Medium priority because:
- Improves long-term maintainability
- Makes testing more granular and reliable
- Facilitates future streaming enhancements
- Not blocking current functionality

## Design Considerations

### Error Handling
- Maintain current error types and messages
- Improve error context with better debugging info
- Consider error recovery strategies

### Performance
- Ensure refactoring doesn't impact streaming performance
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Maintain memory efficiency gains

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual processor methods
- Integration tests for full streaming behavior
- Performance benchmarks to ensure no regression
