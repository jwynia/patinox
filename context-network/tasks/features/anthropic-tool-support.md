# Task: Implement Tool Support for Anthropic Provider

## Status
- **Priority**: High
- **Complexity**: Large
- **Effort**: Large (2-3 days)
- **Dependencies**: Understanding of Anthropic's tool calling API format

## Context
The Anthropic provider currently has a TODO comment for tool support implementation. This feature is needed to enable function calling capabilities for Claude models.

## Problem Statement
The `convert_to_anthropic_format` method in `src/provider/anthropic.rs` line 119 currently sets `tools: None` with a TODO comment. This prevents users from leveraging Claude's function calling capabilities.

## Requirements
1. **Tool Schema Support**: Implement Anthropic's tool calling format
2. **Request Conversion**: Convert internal tool definitions to Anthropic format
3. **Response Parsing**: Handle tool use responses from Claude
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for tool-related failures
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for tool functionality

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research Anthropic Tool API
1. Study Anthropic's tool calling documentation
2. Understand request/response format differences from OpenAI
3. Identify Claude model capabilities for tools

### Phase 2: Update Data Structures
1. Enhance `AnthropicTool` struct (currently placeholder)
2. Add tool response types
3. Update request/response conversion methods

### Phase 3: Implement Tool Conversion
1. Convert internal `ToolCall` format to Anthropic format
2. Handle tool schema validation
3. Update `convert_to_anthropic_format` method

### Phase 4: Response Parsing
1. Parse tool usage from Claude responses
2. Convert back to internal format
3. Handle partial tool responses and errors

### Phase 5: Testing
1. Unit tests for tool conversion
2. Integration tests with mock tool calls
3. Error scenario testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tool calls can be sent to Anthropic provider
- [ ] Tool responses are properly parsed and returned
- [ ] Error handling for invalid tool schemas
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Test coverage >85% for new tool-related code
- [ ] Documentation updated with tool usage examples

## Files to Modify
- `src/provider/anthropic.rs` - Main implementation
- `tests/anthropic_provider_test.rs` - Add tool tests
- Consider adding tool-specific test file

## References
- Anthropic Tool Use API documentation
- OpenAI provider tool implementation for patterns
- Internal tool type definitions in `types.rs`

## Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk**: Tool calling is a complex feature that affects request/response flow. Requires careful testing to avoid breaking existing functionality.

## Notes
This feature will bring the Anthropic provider to parity with OpenAI provider capabilities and enable full Claude model functionality for users.
