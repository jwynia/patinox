# Implement Automated Link Checking

## Classification
- **Domain:** Tooling
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Speculative

## Task Summary
Implement automated tools and processes to prevent future broken links in the context network, including detection scripts and maintenance procedures.

## Original Recommendation
**From Context Network Audit 2025-09-18:**
"Implement automated link checking → Prevent future broken links → Maintenance efficiency"

## Problem Description
Currently, link integrity in the context network relies on manual checking, which leads to:

1. **Reactive Problem Discovery**: Broken links found only during audits
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Manual link checking is time-intensive
3. **Quality Drift**: Links break over time without detection
4. **Inconsistent Validation**: No systematic approach to link validation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Link Detection Scripts
- [ ] Script to find all internal links (markdown format and wiki-style)
- [ ] Script to validate file existence for links
- [ ] Script to check external URL accessibility
- [ ] Report generation for broken or suspicious links

### Automated Validation
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for link validation
- [ ] CI/CD integration for link checking
- [ ] Regular scheduled link audits
- [ ] Notification system for broken links

### Link Standards
- [ ] Guidelines for acceptable link formats
- [ ] Standards for internal vs external linking
- [ ] Documentation of link checking procedures
- [ ] Error handling for temporary failures

### Maintenance Integration
- [ ] Integration with existing maintenance procedures
- [ ] Documentation of remediation workflows
- [ ] Escalation procedures for persistent issues
- [ ] Metrics and reporting on link health

## Technical Requirements

### Link Discovery
- Support for `[text](path)` markdown links
- Support for `[[wiki-style]]` links
- Detection of relative vs absolute paths
- Handling of section anchors (#heading)

### Validation Logic
- File existence checking for internal links
- HTTP status checking for external URLs
- Timeout and retry logic for external checks
- False positive handling (temporary outages)

### Reporting Features
- Broken link inventory with context
- Link usage frequency analysis
- Historical trend tracking
- Actionable remediation suggestions

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Link Scanner
1. Create script to extract all links from markdown files
2. Implement file existence validation
3. Generate basic broken link report
4. Test on current context network

### Phase 2: Enhanced Validation
1. Add external URL checking with retries
2. Implement intelligent error categorization
3. Add context information (which files contain broken links)
4. Create remediation suggestion engine

### Phase 3: Automation Integration
1. Add pre-commit hook for new/modified files
2. Create CI workflow for pull request validation
3. Implement scheduled maintenance scans
4. Add notification system for maintenance team

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Link usage analytics and optimization
2. Automatic link correction suggestions
3. Integration with content management workflows
4. Performance optimization for large networks

## Tool Architecture

### Core Components
- **Link Extractor**: Parses markdown for all link types
- **Validator**: Checks link targets for accessibility
- **Reporter**: Generates actionable reports
- **Scheduler**: Manages automated checking cycles

### Integration Points
- Git hooks for development workflow
- CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation
- Maintenance procedures for operations
- Notification systems for alerts

### Configuration
- Configurable link checking rules
- Whitelist/blacklist for external domains
- Retry policies for different failure types
- Report format and delivery preferences

## Example Implementation

### Basic Link Checker Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# find-broken-links.sh
# Scans context network for broken internal links

find context-network -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\[.*\](" {} \; | while read file; do
    grep -o "\[.*\]([^)]*)" "$file" | while read link; do
        path=$(echo "$link" | sed 's/.*(\([^)]*\)).*/\1/')
        if [[ "$path" =~ ^[^h] ]]; then # internal link
            if [ ! -f "$(dirname "$file")/$path" ]; then
                echo "BROKEN: $file -> $path"
            fi
        fi
    done
done
```

### CI Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/link-check.yml
name: Link Check
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  link-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Check Internal Links
        run: ./scripts/find-broken-links.sh
      - name: Check External Links
        uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1
```

## Why Deferred
- **Effort**: Large (requires script development and integration setup)
- **Risk**: Low (tooling improvement, doesn't affect content)
- **Dependencies**: Independent (tooling project)
- **Complexity**: Requires development of new automation tools

## Estimated Effort
**Large (90+ minutes)**
- 30 minutes: Basic link scanner development
- 30 minutes: Validation logic and error handling
- 20 minutes: CI/automation integration
- 10 minutes: Documentation and procedures

## Tools and Technologies
- Bash/Python for link scanning scripts
- GitHub Actions or similar for CI integration
- Cron or systemd timers for scheduled checks
- Markdown parsing libraries (optional enhancement)

## Success Metrics
- Zero undetected broken links for >30 days
- Automated detection of link breaks within 24 hours
- Reduced manual link checking effort
- Improved link quality and network integrity

## Related Work
- [Audit Wiki-Style Links](../documentation/audit-wiki-style-links.md) - Manual link fixing that this automates
- [Navigation Testing](create-navigation-testing-procedures.md) - Manual testing this supplements
- [Network Maintenance](../../meta/maintenance.md) - Maintenance procedures this enhances

## Priority
**Low** - Quality improvement that can be deferred until manual processes are optimized
