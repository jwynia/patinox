# Task: Research Tool Integration for Pattern Identification

## Classification
- **Type**: Tooling / Research
- **Priority**: Low
- **Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
- **Risk**: Low (research only)

## Source
- **From**: Retrospective analysis of Provider Testing Utilities implementation
- **Original Context**: Investigate tools that could automate utility pattern identification
- **Date**: 2025-09-15

## Recommendation
Investigate tools that could automate utility pattern identification to reduce manual effort in finding abstraction opportunities and improve consistency of pattern recognition.

## Rationale for Deferral
- **Priority**: Nice-to-have automation vs. immediate development needs
- **Effort**: Requires significant research and tool evaluation time

- **Capability Assessment**: Understanding of what each tool can/cannot do
- **Integration Plan**: Specific approach for adopting most promising tools
- **ROI Analysis**: Clear business case for tool investment

- **Template Opportunities**: Code that follows similar patterns

### Complexity Analysis
- **Cognitive Complexity**: Functions with high complexity scores
- **Parameter Lists**: Functions with many parameters (utility candidates)
