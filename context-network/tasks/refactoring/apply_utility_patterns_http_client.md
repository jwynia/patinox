# Task: Apply Utility Patterns to HTTP Client Infrastructure

## Classification
- **Type**: Refactoring / Infrastructure Improvement
- **Priority**: High
- **Effort**: Medium (45-60 minutes)
- **Risk**: Medium (affects multiple provider implementations)

## Source
- **From**: Retrospective analysis of Provider Testing Utilities implementation
- **Original Context**: Strategic recommendation from successful utility pattern application
- **Date**: 2025-09-15

## Recommendation
Apply testing utility design patterns (separation of concerns, fluent builders, strategic defaults) to other infrastructure areas, specifically HTTP client configuration and request building.

## Rationale for Deferral
- **Effort**: Requires analysis of existing HTTP infrastructure across multiple providers
- **Risk**: Changes could affect all provider implementations
- **Dependencies**: Need to understand current HTTP patterns before proposing changes
- **Complexity**: Requires design decisions about which patterns apply to non-testing code

## Current Analysis Needed

### HTTP Infrastructure Review
1. **Pattern Identification**: Find duplicated HTTP setup patterns across providers
2. **Configuration Analysis**: Identify common configuration needs (timeouts, retries, headers)
3. **Request Building**: Analyze request construction patterns for standardization opportunities
4. **Error Handling**: Review HTTP error handling consistency across providers

### Potential Utility Areas
- **HttpClientBuilder**: Fluent interface for client configuration with sensible defaults
- **RequestBuilder**: Standardized request construction with provider-specific customization
- **RetryPolicyBuilder**: Configurable retry strategies for different error types
- **ErrorMapper**: Consistent HTTP error to ProviderError conversion

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Pattern Analysis Complete**: Document existing HTTP patterns across all providers
- [ ] **Utility Design**: Define specific utility classes following proven patterns
- [ ] **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step approach for introducing utilities
- [ ] **Migration Strategy**: How to transition existing code without breaking changes
- [ ] **Success Metrics**: Define measurable improvements (code reduction, consistency)

## Success Metrics
- **Code Duplication**: Reduce HTTP setup boilerplate by 30%+
- **Configuration Consistency**: Standardize timeout/retry patterns across providers
- **Developer Experience**: Improve readability of HTTP client setup
- **Maintenance**: Single source of truth for HTTP configuration logic

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Analysis (15 minutes)
- Review HTTP client setup in all provider implementations
- Identify common patterns and configuration needs
- Document current duplication and inconsistencies

### Phase 2: Design (20 minutes)
- Define utility interfaces following established patterns
- Design fluent builders with strategic defaults
- Plan integration with existing provider code

### Phase 3: Implementation (45 minutes)
- Create HTTP utility classes with comprehensive tests
- Follow TDD approach proven effective for utilities
- Implement utilities with same quality standards as testing utilities

### Phase 4: Migration (30 minutes)
- Update one provider implementation as proof of concept
- Validate improvements match success metrics
- Document migration approach for remaining providers

## Related Work
- **Depends on**: `/context-network/discoveries/2025-09-15-testing-utility-patterns.md`
- **Validates**: `/context-network/processes/tdd_success_patterns.md`
- **Enables**: Consistent HTTP infrastructure across provider ecosystem

## Notes
This task applies proven utility development patterns to production infrastructure, extending the success of testing utilities to runtime code. The same separation of concerns, fluent builder patterns, and strategic defaults should improve HTTP client code maintainability and consistency.
