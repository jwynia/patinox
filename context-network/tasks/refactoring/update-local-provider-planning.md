# Update Local Provider Planning Documentation

## Task Overview
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: Medium (30-45 minutes)  
**Risk**: Low  
**Source**: Context Network Sync Report 2025-08-22

## Background
The sync report revealed that local provider foundation is complete, but the planning documents may not reflect the current implementation state. The context network should accurately represent what's been built versus what's still planned.

## Current State
**Implementation Reality** ✅:
- Service discovery system implemented
- Error handling and configuration complete
- Foundation infrastructure ready (1,076 lines of code)
- Module structure established

**Planning Documentation Gap** ❌:
- Planning documents may not reflect foundation completion
- Task breakdown may not align with current implementation state
- Risk assessments may be outdated given completed foundation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Review Current Planning Documents
- [ ] Review `context-network/planning/ollama-lmstudio-providers/` directory
- [ ] Check task breakdown against implementation reality
- [ ] Identify outdated risk assessments or requirements
- [ ] Verify readiness checklists reflect foundation completion

### Update Planning to Match Reality
- [ ] Mark foundation tasks as complete where implemented
- [ ] Update task breakdown to focus on remaining API implementation work
- [ ] Revise risk assessments based on completed foundation
- [ ] Update readiness indicators to reflect current state

### Align with Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Ensure planning aligns with newly created provider implementation tasks
- [ ] Remove or update any obsolete planning items
- [ ] Add any missing planning considerations discovered during sync

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis
1. Read all local provider planning documents
2. Compare against actual implementation in `src/provider/local/`
3. Identify specific gaps between planned and implemented
4. Review related task files and requirements

### Phase 2: Documentation Updates
1. Update task breakdowns to reflect foundation completion
2. Revise risk assessments based on implementation progress
3. Update readiness checklists and requirements
4. Ensure planning documents are internally consistent

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Cross-reference with sync report findings
2. Ensure alignment with created implementation tasks
3. Verify no contradictions between planning and current reality

## Files to Review and Update
- `context-network/planning/ollama-lmstudio-providers/README.md`
- `context-network/planning/ollama-lmstudio-providers/task-breakdown.md`
- `context-network/planning/ollama-lmstudio-providers/risk-assessment.md`
- `context-network/planning/ollama-lmstudio-providers/readiness-checklist.md`
- Any related planning status documents

## Key Updates Expected
- **Foundation Status**: Mark infrastructure tasks as complete
- **Remaining Work**: Focus on API implementation only
- **Risk Levels**: Reduce risks related to architecture/infrastructure  
- **Dependencies**: Update based on completed foundation
- **Effort Estimates**: Adjust based on foundation being ready

## Success Metrics
- Planning documents accurately reflect implementation reality
- No contradictions between planning and sync report findings
- Clear alignment between planning and created implementation tasks
- Future planning decisions can be made from accurate baseline

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All foundation infrastructure marked as complete
- [ ] API implementation work clearly identified as remaining
- [ ] Risk assessments updated for current state
- [ ] Planning documents internally consistent
- [ ] No obsolete or outdated requirements remain
