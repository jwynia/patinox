# Risk Assessment Framework

## Overview

Systematic approach to identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Risk Assessment Process

### 1. Risk Identification

#### Risk Categories

**Technical Risks**
- New technology adoption
- Complex integration requirements
- Performance and scalability concerns
- Security vulnerabilities
- Technical debt accumulation

**Project Risks**
- Timeline and deadline pressures
- Resource availability and allocation
- Scope creep and requirements changes
- Dependencies on external teams/systems
- Communication breakdowns

**Business Risks**
- Market changes and competition
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Customer satisfaction impacts
- Revenue and cost implications
- Strategic alignment shifts

**Operational Risks**
- Infrastructure and deployment issues
- Data loss or corruption
- Service availability and reliability
- Monitoring and alerting gaps
- Disaster recovery preparedness

### 2. Risk Evaluation Matrix

#### Impact Assessment (1-5 Scale)
- **1 - Minimal**: Minor inconvenience, easily worked around
- **2 - Low**: Small impact on timeline or quality
- **3 - Medium**: Moderate impact requiring adjustments
- **4 - High**: Significant impact on delivery or quality
- **5 - Critical**: Project failure or severe consequences

#### Probability Assessment (1-5 Scale)
- **1 - Very Low**: <5% chance of occurring
- **2 - Low**: 5-25% chance of occurring
- **3 - Medium**: 25-50% chance of occurring
- **4 - High**: 50-75% chance of occurring
- **5 - Very High**: >75% chance of occurring

#### Risk Score Calculation
```
Risk Score = Impact × Probability
```

#### Risk Priority Matrix
```
                 Probability
        1    2    3    4    5
    1   1    2    3    4    5
I   2   2    4    6    8   10
m   3   3    6    9   12   15
p   4   4    8   12   16   20
a   5   5   10   15   20   25
c
t
```

**Priority Levels:**
- **Critical (20-25)**: Immediate action required
- **High (15-19)**: Action required within sprint
- **Medium (8-14)**: Monitor and plan mitigation
- **Low (4-7)**: Accept or document for later
- **Very Low (1-3)**: Document only

### 3. Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Prevention Strategies
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk entirely by changing approach
- **Reduce**: Lower probability or impact through planning
- **Research**: Gain more information to reduce uncertainty
- **Prototype**: Build proof-of-concept to validate assumptions

#### Response Strategies
- **Accept**: Acknowledge risk and proceed with awareness
- **Transfer**: Shift risk to external party (insurance, vendors)
- **Contingency**: Prepare backup plans for risk occurrence
- **Monitor**: Track risk indicators and adjust as needed

## Risk Assessment in Development Phases

### 1. Planning Phase Risks

**Common Risks:**
- Unclear or changing requirements
- Unrealistic timeline estimates
- Resource allocation conflicts
- Technology selection uncertainty

**Assessment Questions:**
- Are requirements well-defined and stable?
- Do we have the right skills and experience?
- Are external dependencies identified and managed?
- Is the timeline realistic given scope and resources?

### 2. Development Phase Risks

**Common Risks:**
- Implementation complexity exceeding estimates
- Performance issues discovered late
- Integration problems with external systems
- Quality issues due to time pressure

**Assessment Questions:**
- Are we making progress according to plan?
- Are quality metrics within acceptable ranges?
- Are dependencies progressing as expected?
- Are any technical challenges beyond current capability?

### 3. Testing Phase Risks

**Common Risks:**
- Critical bugs discovered late in cycle
- Test environment issues
- Performance problems under load
- Security vulnerabilities identified

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is test coverage adequate for risk tolerance?
- Are critical user journeys thoroughly tested?
- Have we tested under realistic load conditions?
- Are security requirements validated?

### 4. Deployment Phase Risks

**Common Risks:**
- Production environment differences
- Rollback complexity
- User adoption challenges
- Monitoring and observability gaps

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is the deployment process tested and documented?
- Are rollback procedures defined and tested?
- Is monitoring in place to detect issues quickly?
- Are users prepared for changes?

## Risk Monitoring and Review

### 1. Regular Risk Reviews

#### Sprint Risk Review
- Review existing risks for status changes
- Identify new risks from sprint work
- Update mitigation plans based on progress
- Escalate high-priority risks

#### Monthly Risk Assessment
- Comprehensive review of all documented risks
- Risk trend analysis and pattern identification
- Mitigation strategy effectiveness evaluation
- Risk register cleanup and maintenance

### 2. Risk Metrics and Dashboards

#### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
- Number of critical/high risks
- Average time to risk resolution
- Risk mitigation success rate
- Risk occurrence vs prediction accuracy

#### Dashboard Elements
- Risk heat map by category and priority
- Risk trend charts over time
- Mitigation action status
- Risk exposure by project/component

### 3. Risk Communication
