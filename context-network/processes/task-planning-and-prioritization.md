# Task Planning and Prioritization

## Overview

Systematic approach to task planning, prioritization, and execution that balances business value, technical considerations, and team capacity.

## Planning Framework

### 1. Task Discovery and Capture

#### Sources of Tasks
- **User Stories**: Feature requests and user needs
- **Technical Debt**: Code quality improvements
- **Bug Reports**: Issues and defects
- **Performance**: Optimization opportunities
- **Security**: Vulnerability remediation
- **Maintenance**: Updates and housekeeping

#### Task Documentation Template
```markdown
## Task: [Clear, Action-Oriented Title]

**Type**: [Feature/Bug/Tech Debt/Performance/Security/Maintenance]
**Priority**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Effort**: [XS/S/M/L/XL] (Fibonacci: 1,2,3,5,8)

### Description
[What needs to be done and why]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcomes
- [ ] Clear definition of "done"

### Dependencies
- [ ] Prerequisites that must be completed first
- [ ] External dependencies or blockers

### Risks
- [ ] Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Timeline risks and contingencies
```

### 2. Prioritization Matrix

#### Impact vs Effort Assessment
```
High Impact, Low Effort    → Do First (Quick Wins)
High Impact, High Effort   → Do Second (Major Projects)
Low Impact, Low Effort     → Do Third (Fill-in Tasks)
Low Impact, High Effort    → Don't Do (Question Value)
```

#### Priority Factors
1. **Business Value** (Weight: 40%)
   - User impact
   - Revenue impact
   - Strategic alignment

2. **Technical Value** (Weight: 30%)
   - Code quality improvement
   - Performance impact
   - Security enhancement

3. **Risk Mitigation** (Weight: 20%)
   - Failure probability
   - Failure impact
   - Regulatory compliance

4. **Dependencies** (Weight: 10%)
   - Blocking other work
   - External deadlines
   - Resource availability

### 3. Sprint Planning Process

#### Capacity Planning
- **Team Velocity**: Historical completion rates
- **Available Capacity**: Accounting for meetings, vacation, etc.
- **Skill Matching**: Right people for right tasks
- **Risk Buffer**: 20% capacity reserved for unknowns

#### Sprint Goals
- **Primary Goal**: One main objective per sprint
- **Secondary Goals**: Supporting objectives
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure achievement

### 4. Backlog Management

#### Backlog Structure
```
Current Sprint (2-week horizon)
├── Committed Tasks (80% capacity)
├── Stretch Tasks (20% capacity)

Next Sprint (2-week horizon)
├── Planned Tasks (ready for commitment)
├── Candidate Tasks (needs refinement)

Future Sprints (6-week horizon)
├── Epics (large features broken down)
├── Technical Debt (continuous improvement)
├── Maintenance (ongoing housekeeping)
```

#### Backlog Refinement
- **Weekly Grooming**: Review and update priorities
- **Estimation Sessions**: Size new tasks
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify blockers
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate uncertainties

## Execution Strategies

### 1. Task Sequencing

#### Serial vs Parallel Work
- **Sequential**: Tasks with dependencies
- **Parallel**: Independent tasks for team efficiency
- **Critical Path**: Tasks that determine overall timeline

#### Context Switching Minimization
- Group similar tasks together
- Batch communication and meetings
- Protect deep work time blocks

### 2. Progress Tracking

#### Daily Standups
- **Yesterday**: What was completed
- **Today**: What's planned
- **Blockers**: What's preventing progress

#### Sprint Reviews
- **Completed Work**: Demonstration of outcomes
- **Lessons Learned**: What went well/poorly
- **Adjustments**: Process improvements

### 3. Risk Management

#### Risk Categories
- **Technical Risks**: Unknown complexity, new technology
- **Resource Risks**: People availability, skill gaps
- **External Risks**: Dependencies on other teams
- **Scope Risks**: Requirements changes, feature creep

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Early Prototyping**: Reduce technical uncertainty
- **Skill Development**: Training and knowledge sharing
- **Communication**: Regular check-ins with dependencies
- **Scope Control**: Clear requirements and change process

## Decision Framework

### 1. Prioritization Decisions

#### When to Reprioritize
- Critical bugs discovered
- Business priorities change
- New information about effort/impact
- External deadlines shift

#### Decision Criteria
- **Data-Driven**: Use metrics when available
- **Stakeholder Input**: Consider all perspectives
- **Time-Boxed**: Don't over-analyze decisions
- **Reversible**: Most decisions can be changed

### 2. Scope Decisions

#### Scope Reduction Strategies
- **Feature Toggles**: Ship disabled features
- **Phased Delivery**: Release in increments
- **MVP Approach**: Minimum viable product first
- **Technical Debt**: Accept short-term compromises

### 3. Resource Allocation

#### Allocation Principles
- **Skills Matching**: Right expertise for tasks
- **Development Opportunities**: Growth for team members
- **Load Balancing**: Avoid overloading individuals
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Cross-training opportunities

## Planning Tools

### 1. Estimation Techniques

#### Planning Poker
- Team-based estimation
- Relative sizing approach
- Consensus building process

#### T-Shirt Sizing
- XS, S, M, L, XL categories
- Quick, high-level estimates
- Useful for early planning

### 2. Tracking Tools

#### Task Boards
- Visual representation of work
- Clear status progression
- Team transparency

#### Burndown Charts
- Progress visualization
- Early warning of delays
- Sprint goal tracking

## Success Metrics

### Planning Effectiveness
- **Velocity Consistency**: Predictable delivery rates
- **Scope Accuracy**: Delivered scope vs planned scope
- **Timeline Accuracy**: Actual vs estimated duration
- **Priority Alignment**: High-priority tasks completed first

### Team Satisfaction
- **Workload Balance**: No team members overloaded
- **Goal Clarity**: Clear understanding of objectives
- **Autonomy**: Team input in planning decisions
- **Growth**: Skill development opportunities
