# Resolved Architectural Decisions

## Purpose
Document the resolution of critical architectural questions that were blocking implementation. These decisions were made through systematic analysis with full consideration of long-term architectural goals.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Architecture
- **Stability:** Static
- **Abstraction:** Policy
- **Confidence:** Established

## Decision Resolution Process

**Date Resolved:** 2025-08-18
**Method:** Systematic pros/cons analysis with long-term architecture consideration
**Participants:** Development team with strategic planning context

## Resolved Decisions

### 1. MAPE-K Pattern Appropriateness ✅ KEEP WITH MODIFICATIONS

**Decision**: Retain MAPE-K pattern but make it optional for simple agents

**Rationale**: 
- 40% task completion improvement justifies complexity for advanced use cases
- Optional implementation allows simple agents to opt out
- Aligns with long-term self-improvement goals
- Can be simplified in Phase 1, expanded in Phase 4

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Basic monitoring hooks (optional)
- Phase 2: Add analysis capabilities
- Phase 4: Full MAPE-K with evolution

### 2. Crate Structure Optimization ✅ REFINED TO 8 CRATES

**Decision**: Streamline to 8 crates with strategic merging

**Final Structure**:
1. `patinox-core` - Core traits and types
2. `patinox-agent` - Agent state machines
3. `patinox-runtime` - Orchestration + basic storage
4. `patinox-validation` - Tower middleware
5. `patinox-monitor` - Async monitoring
6. `patinox-telemetry` - OpenTelemetry integration
7. `patinox-meta` - Analysis + git evolution (merged)
8. Language bindings - As needed

**Rationale**:
- Merges patinox-meta + patinox-evolution (both handle self-improvement)
- Defers patinox-storage to Phase 3 (start with basic persistence in runtime)
- Maintains clear separation of concerns
- Supports all planned long-term features

### 3. Concurrency Model Selection ✅ ASYNC TASKS WITH CHANNELS

**Decision**: Use async tasks with channels instead of full actor model

**Rationale**:
- Simpler to implement and debug
- Native Rust/Tokio ecosystem support
- Lower overhead than external actor libraries
- Can add actor abstractions later if needed
- Better integration with existing async ecosystem

**Migration Path**: Can add actor-like abstractions in Phase 2+ without breaking changes

### 4. MVP Scope Definition ✅ AGENT + TOOL + BASIC VALIDATION

**Decision**: MVP includes agent execution, tool integration, and one validator

**Scope**:
- Agent that executes tools successfully
- Basic error handling and recovery
- Simple configuration system
- One validator (anti-jailbreak) demonstrating Tower middleware
- Core traits implemented

**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates core value proposition (safe agent execution)
- Shows middleware architecture working
- Achievable complexity for Phase 1
- Differentiates from simple LLM libraries

### 5. Typestate Pattern Complexity ✅ MINIMAL TYPESTATE

**Decision**: Focus on key state transitions only

**Implementation**:
- Core states: Created → Configured → Started → Running → Stopped
- Builder pattern for configuration phase
- Skip micro-state management
- Prioritize ergonomics over comprehensive compile-time safety

**Rationale**:
- Balances safety with usability
- Focuses on states users actually care about
- Can expand to full typestate in later phases
- Lower learning curve for adoption

### 6. Tower Middleware Composition ✅ LINEAR STACK INITIALLY

**Decision**: Start with linear middleware stack, expand later

**Implementation**:
```rust
ServiceBuilder::new()
    .layer(AntiJailbreakLayer)
    .layer(RateLimitLayer)
    .layer(CircuitBreakerLayer)
    .service(agent_service)
```

**Rationale**:
- Standard Tower pattern, well understood
- Simple to implement and debug
- Can add conditional/parallel validation in Phase 2
- Proven approach in HTTP middleware

### 7. Testing Strategy ✅ HYBRID APPROACH

**Decision**: Multiple testing tools for different levels

**Strategy**:
- **Unit tests**: `mockall` for fast business logic testing
- **Integration tests**: `wiremock` for HTTP-level testing
- **Validation tests**: Recorded interactions for prompt effectiveness
- **Property tests**: `proptest` for complex logic validation

**Rationale**:
- Best tool for each testing level
- Fast feedback loop with comprehensive coverage
- Balances speed, reliability, and realism

### 8. Migration Strategy ✅ SIDE-BY-SIDE INTEGRATION

**Decision**: Enable incremental adoption alongside existing tools

**Approach**:
- Patinox agents integrate with existing LangChain applications
- No forced migration timeline
- Clear examples of common integration patterns
- Value-driven adoption

**Rationale**:
- Lower adoption barrier
- Allows proof of value before commitment
- Respects existing investments
- Scales with user confidence

### 9. Documentation Strategy ✅ EXAMPLE-DRIVEN

**Decision**: Focus on working examples that double as tests

**Approach**:
- 3-5 complete, runnable examples for core features
- Examples serve as integration tests
- Minimal prose, maximum working code
- Community-contributed examples over time

**Rationale**:
- Guarantees documentation stays current
- Shows real usage patterns
- Easy to validate and maintain
- Scales with community growth

### 10. Monitoring Performance ✅ CONFIGURABLE WITH SAMPLING

**Decision**: Configurable monitoring levels with sampling for high-frequency events

**Implementation**:
- Default: Lightweight monitoring (errors, performance metrics)
- Opt-in: Detailed monitoring (full request traces)
- Sampling: Statistical accuracy for high-frequency events
- Zero overhead when disabled

**Rationale**:
- Production performance protection
- Development visibility
- Statistical accuracy without overhead
- Proven APM approach

### 11. Development Environment ✅ DEVCONTAINERS

**Decision**: Use VS Code devcontainers for development environment

**Implementation**:
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` with Rust toolchain
- Pre-configured extensions and tools
- Consistent environment across team
- CI/CD pipeline matches devcontainer setup

**Rationale**:
- Team lead uses devcontainers for all development
- Ensures consistent development environment
- Simplifies onboarding for new contributors
- Container-based approach aligns with deployment strategy

## Strategic Alignment

All decisions maintain alignment with long-term architectural goals:

- **Phase 1 Foundation**: Simple implementations that don't preclude future complexity
- **Phase 2 Validation**: Tower architecture supports planned safety features
- **Phase 3 Monitoring**: Configurable monitoring supports full observability
- **Phase 4 Evolution**: MAPE-K + git integration supports self-improvement
