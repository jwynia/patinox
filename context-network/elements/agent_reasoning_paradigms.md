# Agent Reasoning Paradigms: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Overview

Most agent frameworks default to the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) paradigm without considering that different reasoning patterns excel at different tasks. This document explores various agent reasoning paradigms, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they can be combined for optimal performance.

## Core Paradigms

### 1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

**Pattern**: Thought → Action → Observation → Repeat

**How it works**:
1. Agent reasons about the current state (Thought)
2. Decides on an action to take (Action)
3. Observes the result of the action (Observation)
4. Repeats until goal is achieved

**Strengths**:
- Excellent for tool use and external interactions
- Grounded reasoning through observations
- Clear trace of decision-making process
- Widely supported in existing frameworks

**Weaknesses**:
- Can get stuck in repetitive loops
- Verbose output with many intermediate steps
- Single-path exploration limits creativity
- May overthink simple tasks

**Best for**:
- Tasks requiring external tools
- API interactions
- Information retrieval
- Step-by-step problem solving with feedback

**Example Implementation**:
```rust
struct ReactAgent {
    max_iterations: usize,
    tools: HashMap<String, Box<dyn Tool>>,
}

impl ReactAgent {
    async fn execute(&self, task: Task) -> Result<Output> {
        let mut state = AgentState::new(task);
        
        for _ in 0..self.max_iterations {
            let thought = self.think(&state).await?;
            let action = self.decide_action(&thought).await?;
            let observation = self.execute_action(&action).await?;
            
            state.update(thought, action, observation);
            
            if self.is_complete(&state) {
                return Ok(self.extract_output(state));
            }
        }
        
        Err(Error::MaxIterationsReached)
    }
}
```

### 2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

**Pattern**: Problem → Step-by-step reasoning → Conclusion

**How it works**:
1. Break down complex problem into steps
2. Reason through each step sequentially
3. Build upon previous steps
4. Arrive at final conclusion

**Strengths**:
- Excellent for mathematical reasoning
- Strong logical deduction capabilities
- Transparent reasoning process
- Lower computational cost than tree-based methods

**Weaknesses**:
- No external validation of reasoning
- Can hallucinate intermediate steps
- Single reasoning path may miss alternatives
- No built-in error correction

**Best for**:
- Mathematical problems
- Logical puzzles
- Step-by-step analysis
- Explanation generation

**Example Implementation**:
```rust
struct CoTAgent {
    reasoning_depth: usize,
}

impl CoTAgent {
    async fn reason(&self, problem: Problem) -> Result<Solution> {
        let mut reasoning_chain = Vec::new();
        let mut current_state = problem.initial_state();
        
        for step in 0..self.reasoning_depth {
            let reasoning_step = self.generate_step(&current_state).await?;
            reasoning_chain.push(reasoning_step.clone());
            
            current_state = self.apply_reasoning(&current_state, &reasoning_step)?;
            
            if self.is_solution(&current_state) {
                return Ok(Solution::from_chain(reasoning_chain));
            }
        }
        
        Ok(Solution::partial(reasoning_chain))
    }
}
```

### 3. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

**Pattern**: Explore multiple reasoning paths → Evaluate → Backtrack/Continue

**How it works**:
1. Generate multiple potential next steps
2. Evaluate each path using heuristics
3. Explore promising branches deeper
4. Backtrack from dead ends
5. Select best complete path

**Strengths**:
- Explores multiple solutions simultaneously
- Can backtrack from poor decisions
- Finds globally optimal solutions
- Handles complex, multi-step problems

**Weaknesses**:
- Computationally expensive (multiple LLM calls)
- Requires good evaluation function
- Complex to implement correctly
- May explore many unnecessary paths

**Best for**:
- Creative writing
- Strategic planning
- Complex puzzle solving
- Optimization problems

**Example Implementation**:
```rust
struct ToTAgent {
    branching_factor: usize,
    max_depth: usize,
    evaluator: Box<dyn PathEvaluator>,
}

impl ToTAgent {
    async fn search(&self, problem: Problem) -> Result<Solution> {
        let mut frontier = BinaryHeap::new();
        frontier.push(SearchNode::root(problem));
        
        while let Some(node) = frontier.pop() {
            if node.is_solution() {
                return Ok(node.to_solution());
            }
            
            if node.depth < self.max_depth {
                let children = self.generate_children(&node, self.branching_factor).await?;
                
                for child in children {
                    let score = self.evaluator.evaluate(&child).await?;
                    child.set_score(score);
                    frontier.push(child);
                }
            }
        }
        
        Err(Error::NoSolutionFound)
    }
}
```

### 4. Graph of Thoughts (GoT)

**Pattern**: Non-linear exploration → Merge paths → Aggregate insights

**How it works**:
1. Generate initial thoughts as nodes
2. Create connections between related thoughts
3. Explore paths through the graph
4. Merge converging paths
5. Aggregate insights from multiple paths

**Strengths**:
- Handles interconnected concepts well
- Parallel exploration of ideas
- Can merge insights from different paths
- Represents complex relationships

**Weaknesses**:
- Very complex to implement
- High computational cost
- Difficult to define merge operations
- May create overly complex representations

**Best for**:
- Research synthesis
- Knowledge graph construction
- Complex system analysis
- Multi-faceted problem solving

**Example Implementation**:
```rust
struct GoTAgent {
    graph: Graph<Thought, Relation>,
    merger: Box<dyn PathMerger>,
}

impl GoTAgent {
    async fn explore(&self, problem: Problem) -> Result<Solution> {
        let mut graph = self.initialize_graph(problem).await?;
        
        loop {
            let expansion_points = self.select_expansion_points(&graph);
            
            for point in expansion_points {
                let new_thoughts = self.generate_thoughts(&point).await?;
                self.add_to_graph(&mut graph, new_thoughts);
            }
            
            let convergence_points = self.find_convergences(&graph);
            for points in convergence_points {
                let merged = self.merger.merge(points).await?;
                graph.add_merged_node(merged);
            }
            
            if let Some(solution) = self.extract_solution(&graph) {
                return Ok(solution);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Reflexion

**Pattern**: Act → Evaluate → Reflect → Retry with insights

**How it works**:
1. Attempt to solve the problem
2. Evaluate the attempt's success
3. Reflect on what went wrong/right
4. Generate insights for improvement
5. Retry with accumulated knowledge

**Strengths**:
- Learns from mistakes
- Improves with each iteration
- Builds problem-specific knowledge
- Self-correcting behavior

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires multiple iterations
- Needs memory/context management
- May fixate on certain approaches
- Slower than single-shot methods

**Best for**:
- Code generation
- Writing improvement
- Task learning
- Iterative refinement

**Example Implementation**:
```rust
struct ReflexionAgent {
    max_attempts: usize,
    evaluator: Box<dyn OutputEvaluator>,
    memory: ReflexionMemory,
}

impl ReflexionAgent {
    async fn solve_with_reflection(&mut self, task: Task) -> Result<Solution> {
        for attempt in 0..self.max_attempts {
            let context = self.memory.get_context(&task);
            let solution = self.generate_solution(&task, &context).await?;
            
            let evaluation = self.evaluator.evaluate(&solution, &task).await?;
            
            if evaluation.is_success() {
                return Ok(solution);
            }
            
            let reflection = self.reflect(&solution, &evaluation).await?;
            self.memory.add_insight(task.id(), reflection);
        }
        
        Err(Error::MaxAttemptsReached)
    }
}
```

### 6. Plan-and-Execute

**Pattern**: Generate complete plan → Execute steps sequentially

**How it works**:
1. Analyze the entire problem
2. Generate a complete plan
3. Execute each step of the plan
4. Handle failures with predefined strategies

**Strengths**:
- Efficient for well-defined tasks
- Clear structure and progress tracking
- Minimal LLM calls during execution
- Good for predictable workflows

**Weaknesses**:
- Inflexible to unexpected situations
- Poor adaptation to runtime discoveries
- Entire plan may become invalid
- Requires accurate upfront planning

**Best for**:
- Structured workflows
- Predictable tasks
- Batch processing
- Well-defined procedures

**Example Implementation**:
```rust
struct PlanExecuteAgent {
    planner: Box<dyn Planner>,
    executor: Box<dyn StepExecutor>,
}

impl PlanExecuteAgent {
    async fn execute(&self, task: Task) -> Result<Output> {
        let plan = self.planner.create_plan(&task).await?;
        let mut results = Vec::new();
        
        for step in plan.steps() {
            match self.executor.execute_step(&step).await {
                Ok(result) => results.push(result),
                Err(e) if e.is_recoverable() => {
                    let recovery = self.planner.create_recovery(&step, &e).await?;
                    results.push(self.executor.execute_step(&recovery).await?);
                }
                Err(e) => return Err(e),
            }
        }
        
        Ok(Output::from_results(results))
    }
}
```

### 7. Debate

**Pattern**: Multiple agents argue → Present evidence → Reach consensus

**How it works**:
1. Multiple agents take different positions
2. Each presents arguments and evidence
3. Agents critique each other's arguments
4. Iterate until consensus or max rounds
5. Synthesize final answer

**Strengths**:
- Reduces individual agent bias
- Explores multiple perspectives
- Self-correcting through critique
- High-quality outputs for complex topics

**Weaknesses**:
- Very expensive (multiple agents)
- Complex coordination required
- May not reach consensus
- Slower than single-agent approaches

**Best for**:
- Complex decision-making
- Fact-checking
- Ethical reasoning
- Multi-perspective analysis

**Example Implementation**:
```rust
struct DebateAgent {
    debaters: Vec<Box<dyn Debater>>,
    moderator: Box<dyn Moderator>,
    max_rounds: usize,
}

impl DebateAgent {
    async fn debate(&self, topic: Topic) -> Result<Consensus> {
        let mut positions = Vec::new();
        
        // Initial positions
        for debater in &self.debaters {
            positions.push(debater.initial_position(&topic).await?);
        }
        
        for round in 0..self.max_rounds {
            // Present arguments
            let mut arguments = Vec::new();
            for (i, debater) in self.debaters.iter().enumerate() {
                let others = positions.iter().enumerate()
                    .filter(|(j, _)| i != *j)
                    .map(|(_, p)| p)
                    .collect();
                    
                arguments.push(debater.argue(&positions[i], &others).await?);
            }
            
            // Check for consensus
            if let Some(consensus) = self.moderator.check_consensus(&arguments).await? {
                return Ok(consensus);
            }
            
            // Update positions based on arguments
            for (i, debater) in self.debaters.iter().enumerate() {
                positions[i] = debater.update_position(&positions[i], &arguments).await?;
            }
        }
        
        // Force consensus after max rounds
        Ok(self.moderator.synthesize(&positions).await?)
    }
}
```
