# Elements Section - V2 Evolution Strategy

## Current Status: Unpopulated (By Design)

This directory is intentionally empty as part of the V2 minimal-first strategic reset (October 12, 2025).

## Why Empty?

The V2 approach builds **minimal → sophisticated** rather than sophisticated-first:

1. **Build working agents first** (Layer 1-2) - October 2025
2. **Identify patterns through real usage** - What actually hurts?
3. **Document validated patterns** - Only after pain is felt
4. **Import V1 components** - When usage proves need (Layer 4)

## What Goes Here (Eventually)

As patterns emerge from V2 development, this section will contain:

### Layer 1-2 Elements (Current Focus - October 2025)
- Agent Core (minimal ReACT loop)
- Tool System (function closures)
- Provider Abstraction (LLM integration)
- Plugin Architecture (pain-driven enhancements)

### Layer 3 Elements (November 2025+)
- Reasoning Patterns (plan-execute, reflexion)
- Multi-Agent Coordination
- Tool Composition

### Layer 4 Elements (Q1 2026+)
- MAPE-K Monitoring (imported from V1)
- Tower Validation (imported from V1)
- TypeState Patterns (imported from V1)
- Git-Based Evolution

## Where Is Current Documentation?

Instead of this section, V2 technical documentation is currently in:

- **Architecture Decisions**: `context-network/decisions/`
- **Planning Documents**: `context-network/planning/`
- **Implementation Records**: `context-network/records/`
- **V1 Research**: `context-network/archive/v1-research/elements/`

## Navigation

- See `index.md` in this directory for full explanation
- See `context-network/decisions/v2_strategic_reset.md` for V2 strategy
- See `context-network/planning/roadmap.md` for timeline

## This Is Not A Mistake

This directory exists to:
1. Maintain navigation structure (discovery.md references it)
2. Provide clear destination for future element documentation
3. Explain V2 evolution strategy to future contributors
4. Prevent premature sophistication

**The emptiness is the point.** It embodies V2's minimal-first philosophy.
