# Project Principles

## Purpose
This document outlines the core principles and standards that guide decision-making and development across the project.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Core Concept
- **Stability:** Static
- **Abstraction:** Conceptual
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Core Values

1. **Safety Through Compilation**
   Invalid states should be unrepresentable. The type system is our first and strongest line of defense against errors. What can be validated at compile time should never be deferred to runtime.

2. **Monitoring as Architecture**
   Observability isn't added after the factâ€”it's woven into every layer. Every action is traceable, every decision is logged, and every pattern is analyzable.

3. **Traceable Evolution**
   Systems improve through auditable changes, not opaque mutations. Every enhancement goes through version control, code review, and systematic deployment.

4. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**
   Safety and monitoring features should have no runtime overhead when disabled. Performance is a feature, not a trade-off.

5. **Fearless Concurrency**
   Parallel execution should be safe by default. Race conditions and data races should be compile-time errors, not runtime surprises.

### Design Principles

1. **Typestate-Driven Workflows**
   Agent states are encoded in the type system. Transitions between states are method calls that consume the old state and produce the new one.
   
   *Example:* An agent in the `Initialized` state can only call `validate()`, which consumes it and returns either `Validated` or an error.

2. **Layered Validation Architecture**
   Validators compose like middleware layers. Each layer can inspect, modify, or reject agent actions independently.
   
   *Example:* `ServiceBuilder::new().layer(SecurityValidator).layer(HallucinationDetector).layer(RateLimiter)`

3. **Embedded Monitoring Pattern**
   Every execution path includes monitoring hooks. Synchronous validators gate progress; asynchronous analyzers observe without blocking.
   
   *Example:* Anti-jailbreak validators run synchronously before tool execution, while pattern analyzers run asynchronously to identify improvement opportunities.

4. **Git-Based Evolution Loop**
   Improvements are proposed as pull requests, not runtime mutations. This ensures every change is reviewable, testable, and reversible.
   
   *Example:* The meta-layer analyzes telemetry and generates a PR to optimize prompt templates, which goes through standard CI/CD.

5. **Trait-Based Composition**
   Core functionality is defined through traits, not concrete types. This enables pluggable implementations without modifying framework code.
   
   *Example:* Any type implementing the `Validator` trait can be added to the validation pipeline without framework changes.

### Standards and Guidelines

[List and describe the standards and guidelines that the project adheres to]

#### Quality Standards

- All public APIs must be documented with examples
- Every state transition must be type-safe
- All errors must be recoverable or explicitly marked as panics
- Benchmarks must demonstrate zero-cost when features are disabled
- Test coverage must include both unit and integration tests

#### Structural Standards

- Crates follow single-responsibility principle
- Public interfaces are minimal and orthogonal
- Dependencies are explicitly versioned and audited
- Unsafe code is isolated and thoroughly documented
- Module boundaries align with architectural layers

#### Safety and Security Standards

- Memory safety guaranteed through Rust ownership model
- No unsafe code in core abstractions (only in proven libraries)
- All LLM interactions pass through validation layer
- Sensitive data never logged or exposed in errors
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers on all external calls

#### Performance and Efficiency Standards

- Zero-copy operations wherever possible
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Lazy evaluation for expensive computations
- Benchmarks for all performance-critical paths
- Memory usage suitable for edge deployment

### Process Principles

1. **Compile-First Development**
   If it compiles, it should work correctly. Runtime errors indicate design flaws that should be addressed through type system improvements.

2. **Telemetry-Driven Decisions**
   Every architectural decision is validated through metrics. Assumptions are tested, patterns are measured, and improvements are quantified.

3. **Incremental Enhancement**
   Start with a minimal, correct implementation. Add features through composition, not modification. Preserve backward compatibility through versioning.

4. **Documentation as Code**
   Documentation lives alongside code and is tested for accuracy. Examples in docs are compiled and run in CI.

5. **Community-Driven Evolution**
   Design decisions are discussed openly. RFCs for major changes. User feedback drives prioritization.

### Decision-Making Framework

[Describe the framework used for making decisions in the project]

#### Decision Criteria

- **Safety**: Does this make invalid states unrepresentable?
- **Performance**: Is this zero-cost when not used?
- **Observability**: Can this be monitored and analyzed?
- **Composability**: Does this work with existing components?
- **Simplicity**: Is this the minimal solution that works?

#### Trade-off Considerations

- **Compile time vs Runtime flexibility**: Favor compile-time safety
- **Performance vs Convenience**: Provide both with opt-in convenience
- **Completeness vs Simplicity**: Start simple, extend through composition
- **Innovation vs Stability**: Stable core, experimental extensions
- **Purity vs Pragmatism**: Pragmatic interfaces, pure internals

### Principle Application

[Describe how these principles should be applied in practice]

#### When Principles Conflict

1. **Safety trumps performance**: Never compromise safety for speed
2. **Explicit over implicit**: When in doubt, make it explicit
3. **User control over automation**: Users can override automatic behaviors
4. **Observability over privacy**: Log everything except sensitive data
5. **Compatibility over purity**: Support migration paths from existing systems

#### Exceptions to Principles

- **Unsafe code**: Only in performance-critical paths with extensive documentation and testing
- **Runtime validation**: For user-provided configurations that cannot be known at compile time
- **Synchronous operations**: Only for sub-millisecond operations that cannot be made async
- **Breaking changes**: Only for security fixes or fundamental design flaws
- **Logging sensitive data**: Only in explicit debug mode with user consent
