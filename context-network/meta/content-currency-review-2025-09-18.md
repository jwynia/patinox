# Content Currency Review - September 18, 2025

## Purpose
Comprehensive review and update of stale content identified through systematic audit of context network documents, with focus on "Dynamic" stability documents and early 2025 discovery records.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Maintenance
- **Stability:** Static
- **Abstraction:** Operational
- **Confidence:** Established

## Review Summary

### Documents Updated

#### 1. Project Roadmap (/planning/roadmap.md)
**Status:** âœ… MAJOR UPDATE COMPLETED
**Issues Found:**
- Roadmap dates were 8+ months stale (last updated January 2025)
- Current phase incorrectly listed as "Pre-Phase 1 - Research & Design"
- Milestone targets showed dates already passed without status updates
- No reflection of actual project progress (Phase 1 completion)

**Actions Taken:**
- Updated current phase to "Phase 2 - Validation Pipeline"
- Marked Phase 1 as completed with accurate completion dates
- Updated Gantt chart to reflect current reality
- Added progress indicators (âœ… Completed, ðŸ”„ In Progress, ðŸ“… Planned)
- Updated milestone targets with realistic dates based on current progress
- Refreshed metadata with current date (2025-09-18)

**Impact:** Critical planning document now accurately reflects project reality

#### 2. Project Milestones (/planning/milestones.md)
**Status:** âœ… TEMPLATE COMPLETED
**Issues Found:**
- Document was entirely placeholder template content
- No actual milestone information despite project being 70% complete
- Missing tracking of completed work and current progress

**Actions Taken:**
- Populated all 6 milestones with detailed information
- Added comprehensive milestone tracking table
- Included detailed deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Added milestone review and adjustment processes
- Updated metadata and change history

**Impact:** Project now has comprehensive milestone tracking and planning

#### 3. Planning Status (/planning/planning_status.md)
**Status:** âœ… MAJOR UPDATE COMPLETED
**Issues Found:**
- Status showed "READY TO CODE" despite being in Phase 2 of implementation
- Implementation progress not reflected in status indicators
- Current work phase incorrectly described

**Actions Taken:**
- Updated from "READY TO CODE" to "PHASE 2 IN PROGRESS"
- Added current phase summary with completed vs. in-progress items
- Updated progress indicators to reflect 70% overall completion
- Added current phase description (Validation Infrastructure)
- Refreshed metadata with current status

**Impact:** Planning status now accurately represents current project state

### Documents Verified as Current

#### Discovery Records (2025-01-xx series)
**Status:** âœ… VERIFIED CURRENT
**Files Reviewed:**
- `/discovery/2025-01-20-003-tdd-async-workflow.md`
- `/discovery/2025-01-20-001-async-drop-pattern.md`
- `/discovery/2025-01-18-001-test-quality-patterns.md`
- `/discovery/2025-01-20-002-priority-queue-cleanup.md`

**Assessment:** All early 2025 discovery records contain timeless patterns and insights that remain highly relevant. No updates needed.

#### Technology References
**Status:** âœ… VERIFIED CURRENT
**Assessment:** External links and technology version references checked across context network. Most references are to stable documentation or architectural patterns. Archived research document contains many external links but is appropriately marked as archived historical content.

### Content Already Properly Managed

#### Superseded/Deprecated Content
**Status:** âœ… PROPERLY MARKED
**Items Verified:**
- `/meta/updates.md` - Properly marked as DEPRECATED with clear migration path
- `/decisions/CRITICAL_NO_CODING_YET.md` - Correctly marked as SUPERSEDED in index
- Archive folder content - Appropriately separated from current work

## Audit Findings

### Dynamic Stability Documents Review

Documents marked with "Stability: Dynamic" were systematically reviewed:

1. **Planning Documents**: All major planning documents updated to current reality
2. **Milestone Tracking**: Comprehensive milestone system now in place
3. **Decision Records**: Current status properly reflected
4. **Process Documents**: Recent updates show active maintenance

### Content Quality Assessment

**Overall Health:** âœ… EXCELLENT
- No broken internal references identified
- External technology references current and appropriate
- Discovery records maintain historical value
- Proper deprecation/superseding practices in use

## Implementation Impact

### Before Review
- Planning documents showed project as pre-implementation
- Milestones were placeholder templates
- Progress tracking was 8+ months stale
- Dynamic documents lacked recent updates

### After Review
- All planning documents reflect current project reality (Phase 2, 70% complete)
- Comprehensive milestone tracking system in place
- Current phase work clearly documented
- Maintenance practices verified and functioning

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
- âœ… Update all stale planning documents
- âœ… Populate milestone templates with actual data
- âœ… Verify discovery record currency
- âœ… Check external reference validity

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. **Monthly Reviews**: Check "Dynamic" stability documents for currency
2. **Milestone Updates**: Update milestone progress bi-weekly during active phases
3. **Planning Sync**: Quarterly sync of planning documents with project reality
4. **Link Validation**: Annual check of external references for broken links

### Process Improvements
1. **Automation**: Consider automated checks for stale "Last Updated" dates
2. **Templates**: Ensure templates are clearly marked to prevent confusion
3. **Status Indicators**: Standardize progress indicators across all documents

## Metrics

### Content Updated
- **Major Updates**: 3 critical planning documents
- **Template Completion**: 1 comprehensive milestone system
- **Metadata Refresh**: 3 documents with current timestamps
- **Status Alignment**: 100% of planning documents now current

### Content Verified
- **Discovery Records**: 4 early-2025 records confirmed relevant
- **Technology References**: External links and versions verified current
- **Deprecated Content**: Proper marking and archival confirmed

### Quality Indicators
- **Stale Content**: Reduced from 3 major documents to 0
