## Issues Requiring Attention

### Production Readiness Gaps
1. **Mock Streaming Implementation** (Medium severity)
   - **Issue**: Current streaming uses mock responses, not real HTTP
   - **Location**: `src/provider/local/ollama.rs:370-390`, `src/provider/local/lmstudio.rs:376-396`
   - **Action**: Task-007 created to implement real HTTP streaming

2. **Duplicate Validation Logic** (Medium severity)
   - **Issue**: 20+ lines of duplicate validation between streaming/non-streaming methods
   - **Location**: Both local providers have duplicate validation patterns
   - **Action**: Task-006 created to extract shared validation utilities

### Code Quality Issues
3. **Error Handling Patterns** (Medium severity)
   - **Issue**: format! calls instead of proper error chaining in validators
   - **Locations**: Multiple validator files (see sync-state.json for specifics)
   - **Action**: Recommend thiserror-based error chaining improvement

4. **Configuration Validation** (Medium severity)
   - **Issue**: Regex patterns not validated at construction time
   - **Location**: `src/validation/validators/request_validator.rs:58-70`
   - **Action**: Add construction-time validation for all config parameters
