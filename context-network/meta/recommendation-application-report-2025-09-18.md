## ðŸ“‹ Deferred to Tasks

### High Priority Tasks Created

#### Task: Replace Template Content in Connections Directory
**Original Recommendation**: Replace template content in connections/ â†’ Provide actual project information
**Why Deferred**: Requires deep architectural knowledge of Patinox components and actual system interfaces
**Effort Estimate**: Medium (30-60 minutes)
**Created at**: `/tasks/documentation/replace-template-content-connections.md`

**Scope**: Update dependencies.md and interfaces.md with actual Patinox framework component relationships instead of placeholder content.

#### Task: Audit and Fix Wiki-Style Links
**Original Recommendation**: Audit wiki-style links â†’ Fix broken cross-references â†’ Restore network integrity
**Why Deferred**: Requires systematic investigation of 10+ broken links and editorial decisions
**Effort Estimate**: Medium (45-90 minutes)
**Created at**: `/tasks/documentation/audit-wiki-style-links.md`

**Scope**: Systematically catalog and fix all [[wiki-style]] links, creating missing targets or updating references.

### Medium Priority Tasks Created

#### Task: Enhance Relationship Documentation
**Original Recommendation**: Enhance relationship documentation â†’ Improve network navigation
**Why Deferred**: Requires content analysis and semantic relationship design across entire network
**Effort Estimate**: Medium (60-90 minutes)
**Created at**: `/tasks/documentation/enhance-relationship-documentation.md`

**Scope**: Add bidirectional linking and specific relationship types throughout the network.

#### Task: Review Content Currency
