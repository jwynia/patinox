### Roadmap Overview

Patinox development follows a four-phase approach, building from core abstractions to a complete self-evolving agent framework. Each phase delivers working functionality while laying groundwork for subsequent phases.

### Current Phase

**Phase: Pre-Phase 1 - Research & Design**
**Status: In Progress**

Currently synthesizing research from 380+ sources to finalize architectural decisions. Establishing core trait definitions and validating approach with proof-of-concept implementations. Setting up development infrastructure and community engagement channels.

### Release Strategy

**Version Scheme**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Pre-1.0: Breaking changes allowed in minor versions
- Post-1.0: Strict semver with deprecation cycles

**Release Cadence**:
- Alpha releases: Every 2 weeks during active development
- Beta releases: Monthly after feature completion
- Stable releases: Quarterly after comprehensive testing

**Distribution**:
- crates.io for Rust crates
- PyPI for Python bindings
- npm for TypeScript bindings
- GitHub releases with precompiled binaries
- Docker images for containerized deployment

### Resource Allocation

**Core Team Focus**:
- 40% - Core framework development
- 25% - Validation and monitoring implementation
- 20% - Documentation and examples
- 15% - Community support and review

**Infrastructure**:
- GitHub for source control and CI/CD
- Discord/Matrix for community collaboration
- docs.rs for API documentation
- Benchmarking infrastructure for performance validation

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| LLM API Changes | High | Medium | Abstract provider interfaces, support multiple providers |
| Performance Overhead | High | Low | Continuous benchmarking, zero-cost abstraction validation |
| Adoption Barriers | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive docs, migration guides, language bindings |
| Ecosystem Fragmentation | Medium | High | Focus on trait-based interfaces, maximize compatibility |
| Complexity Creep | High | Medium | Regular architecture reviews, simplicity as core principle |

### Roadmap Review Process

**Quarterly Reviews**: Full roadmap assessment with community input
- Evaluate milestone progress
- Adjust timelines based on velocity
- Incorporate user feedback and new requirements

- Update milestone status
- Identify and address blockers
- Communicate changes to community

**RFC Process**: Major changes require Request for Comments
- Community discussion period (2 weeks minimum)
- Implementation plan before major work begins
- Documented decisions in context network
