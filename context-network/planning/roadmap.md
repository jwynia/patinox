### Roadmap Overview

Patinox development follows a four-phase approach, building from core abstractions to a complete self-evolving agent framework. Each phase delivers working functionality while laying groundwork for subsequent phases.

### Current Phase

**Phase: 2 - Validation Pipeline**
**Status: In Progress**

Core foundation has been completed with all fundamental infrastructure in place. Currently implementing provider-specific features and validation systems. The project has successfully established:
- âœ… Complete error system with recovery strategies
- âœ… Core trait interfaces (Agent, Tool, Validator, Monitor)
- âœ… Type safety infrastructure with builder patterns
- âœ… Memory management utilities
- âœ… Five major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Ollama, LMStudio)

Current focus: Expanding validation capabilities and refining provider implementations.

### Release Strategy

**Version Scheme**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Pre-1.0: Breaking changes allowed in minor versions
- Post-1.0: Strict semver with deprecation cycles

**Release Cadence**:
- Alpha releases: Every 2 weeks during active development
- Beta releases: Monthly after feature completion
- Stable releases: Quarterly after comprehensive testing

**Distribution**:
- crates.io for Rust crates
- PyPI for Python bindings
- npm for TypeScript bindings
- GitHub releases with precompiled binaries
- Docker images for containerized deployment

### Resource Allocation

**Core Team Focus**:
- 40% - Core framework development
- 25% - Validation and monitoring implementation
- 20% - Documentation and examples
- 15% - Community support and review

**Infrastructure**:
- GitHub for source control and CI/CD
- Discord/Matrix for community collaboration
- docs.rs for API documentation
- Benchmarking infrastructure for performance validation

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| LLM API Changes | High | Medium | Abstract provider interfaces, support multiple providers |
| Performance Overhead | High | Low | Continuous benchmarking, zero-cost abstraction validation |
| Adoption Barriers | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive docs, migration guides, language bindings |
| Ecosystem Fragmentation | Medium | High | Focus on trait-based interfaces, maximize compatibility |
| Complexity Creep | High | Medium | Regular architecture reviews, simplicity as core principle |

### Roadmap Review Process
