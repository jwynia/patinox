# Task: Implement Fallback Provider Pattern

## Status
- **Priority**: High
- **Complexity**: Large  
- **Effort**: Large
- **Dependencies**: Core provider implementations

## Context
The `create_fallback_provider` function in `src/provider/mod.rs` currently has a placeholder implementation that only returns the first provider. A robust fallback system is needed for production reliability.

## Problem Statement
The current fallback implementation is incomplete:
1. No actual fallback logic when primary provider fails
2. No circuit breaker pattern for failed providers
3. No configurable fallback strategies
4. No provider health monitoring

## Requirements
1. **Fallback Chain**: Try providers in configured order
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable failing providers
3. **Health Monitoring**: Track provider success/failure rates
4. **Configurable Strategies**: Support different fallback approaches
5. **Observability**: Log and metrics for fallback events
6. **Error Handling**: Preserve error context from all attempts

## Fallback Strategies
1. **Sequential**: Try each provider in order until success
2. **Load Balanced**: Distribute across healthy providers
3. **Capability-Based**: Select best provider for specific model/feature
4. **Cost-Optimized**: Prefer cheaper providers when available

## Implementation Components
1. **FallbackProvider** wrapper implementing `ModelProvider`
2. **ProviderHealth** tracking success rates and circuit breaker state
3. **FallbackConfig** defining strategies and thresholds
4. **ProviderMetrics** for observability and decision making

## Architecture Design
```rust
pub struct FallbackProvider {
    providers: Vec<ProviderWithHealth>,
    strategy: FallbackStrategy,
    config: FallbackConfig,
}

struct ProviderWithHealth {
    provider: Box<dyn ModelProvider>,
    health: Arc<RwLock<ProviderHealth>>,
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multiple providers can be configured in fallback chain
- [ ] Failed providers are temporarily disabled (circuit breaker)
- [ ] Fallback attempts are logged with context
- [ ] Health monitoring tracks provider reliability
- [ ] Configuration supports different fallback strategies
- [ ] Integration tests cover various failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal for healthy providers

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/provider/fallback.rs` - Core fallback implementation
- `src/provider/health.rs` - Provider health monitoring
- `src/provider/config.rs` - Add fallback configuration options
- `src/provider/mod.rs` - Update create_fallback_provider function
- `tests/fallback_integration_test.rs` - Comprehensive testing

## Testing Scenarios
- Primary provider fails, secondary succeeds
- All providers fail, appropriate error returned
- Circuit breaker opens and closes correctly
- Health metrics are tracked accurately
- Different fallback strategies work as expected

## Notes
This is a complex feature that significantly impacts system reliability. Consider implementing in phases:
1. Basic sequential fallback
2. Circuit breaker pattern
3. Advanced strategies and health monitoring
