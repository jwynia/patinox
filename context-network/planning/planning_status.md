### ‚ùì Questions Requiring Answers

#### ‚úÖ RESOLVED Architectural Questions
1. ~~**MAPE-K Appropriateness**: Is the MAPE-K pattern the best choice for our self-adaptive system?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Keep MAPE-K pattern but make optional for simple agents
2. ~~**Crate Boundaries**: Are the 9 proposed crates properly scoped? Should any be combined or split?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Refined to 8 crates with strategic merging
3. ~~**Actor Model**: Is the actor model the right concurrency approach for agent communication?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Use async tasks with channels over actor model

#### ‚úÖ RESOLVED Technical Questions
1. ~~**Typestate Complexity**: Will typestate patterns make the API too complex for users?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Minimal typestate for key transitions only
2. ~~**Tower Middleware**: How exactly will validators compose in the Tower stack?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Linear stack initially, expand later
3. ~~**Performance Overhead**: What's the actual performance cost of embedded monitoring?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Configurable levels with sampling
4. ~~**LLM Abstraction**: How do we handle vastly different LLM provider capabilities?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Designed flexible provider abstraction with cascading configuration

#### ‚úÖ RESOLVED Implementation Questions
1. ~~**MVP Definition**: What's the absolute minimum feature set for a useful v0.1?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Agent + Tool + Basic Validation
2. ~~**Testing Strategy**: How do we test LLM-based validators effectively?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Hybrid approach (mockall + wiremock + recordings)
3. ~~**Migration Path**: How do we make migration from LangChain/Mastra smooth?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Side-by-side integration
4. ~~**Documentation**: What examples and tutorials are essential from day one?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Example-driven documentation

#### Process Questions
1. **Contribution Model**: How will the open-source contribution process work?
2. **Release Cadence**: Is the proposed release schedule realistic?
3. **Community Engagement**: How do we build a community around this project?
4. **Success Metrics**: How do we measure if the project is succeeding?

### üéØ Required Clarifications Before Coding

These MUST be resolved before implementation begins:

1. ~~**Exact First Task**: What specific component do we build first?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Follow sequence in groomed backlog (Project Setup ‚Üí Error System ‚Üí Core Traits)
   
2. ~~**Proof of Concept Scope**: What demonstrates the architecture works?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Agent + Tool + Basic Validation (MVP)

3. ~~**Quality Bar**: What's the standard for the first code?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Production-ready with comprehensive tests and documentation

4. ~~**External Dependencies**: Which external services do we integrate first?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: OpenAI via async-openai (expandable later)

5. ~~**Development Environment**: What's the standard dev setup?~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: VS Code devcontainers (team lead preference)

### üìã Pre-Coding Checklist

Before we can begin coding, these must be complete:

- [x] ~~All architectural questions answered~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: All 10 critical decisions resolved

- [x] ~~Success criteria established~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Defined in architectural decisions
- [x] ~~Development environment documented~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Devcontainers decided and documented
- [x] ~~Testing approach determined~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Hybrid approach defined
- [x] ~~Core interfaces designed~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Complete trait signatures with state augmentation strategies
- [x] ~~Example use cases defined~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Customer support, code review, and data analysis examples
- [x] ~~Human explicitly approves plan~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Human approved implementation start (August 19, 2025)
- [x] ~~Begin coding decision documented~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: `/decisions/begin_coding_decision.md` created

### üìÖ Planning Timeline

**Week 1-2** (Current):
- Document current understanding
- Identify all uncertainties
- List required decisions

**Week 3-4**:
- Resolve architectural questions
- Define MVP scope
- Design core interfaces

**Week 5-6**:
- Validate complete plan
- Create proof-of-concept designs
- Prepare development environment

**Decision Point**:
- Review complete plan
- Make go/no-go decision
- Document coding authorization

## Next Steps

1. **Review this planning status** with human collaborator
2. **Prioritize questions** that need immediate answers
3. **Schedule decision sessions** for critical choices
4. **Create proof-of-concept sketches** (pseudocode only)
5. **Validate assumptions** through research or prototypes

## Important Reminders

‚ö†Ô∏è **No implementation code** until explicit decision
‚ö†Ô∏è **Focus on clarity** over speed
‚ö†Ô∏è **Document all decisions** in context network
‚ö†Ô∏è **Maintain shared understanding** through communication
