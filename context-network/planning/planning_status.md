### ❓ Questions Requiring Answers

#### ✅ RESOLVED Architectural Questions
1. ~~**MAPE-K Appropriateness**: Is the MAPE-K pattern the best choice for our self-adaptive system?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Keep MAPE-K pattern but make optional for simple agents
2. ~~**Crate Boundaries**: Are the 9 proposed crates properly scoped? Should any be combined or split?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Refined to 8 crates with strategic merging
3. ~~**Actor Model**: Is the actor model the right concurrency approach for agent communication?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Use async tasks with channels over actor model

#### ✅ RESOLVED Technical Questions
1. ~~**Typestate Complexity**: Will typestate patterns make the API too complex for users?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Minimal typestate for key transitions only
2. ~~**Tower Middleware**: How exactly will validators compose in the Tower stack?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Linear stack initially, expand later
3. ~~**Performance Overhead**: What's the actual performance cost of embedded monitoring?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Configurable levels with sampling
4. ~~**LLM Abstraction**: How do we handle vastly different LLM provider capabilities?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Designed flexible provider abstraction with cascading configuration

#### ✅ RESOLVED Implementation Questions
1. ~~**MVP Definition**: What's the absolute minimum feature set for a useful v0.1?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Agent + Tool + Basic Validation
2. ~~**Testing Strategy**: How do we test LLM-based validators effectively?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Hybrid approach (mockall + wiremock + recordings)
3. ~~**Migration Path**: How do we make migration from LangChain/Mastra smooth?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Side-by-side integration
4. ~~**Documentation**: What examples and tutorials are essential from day one?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Example-driven documentation

#### Process Questions
1. **Contribution Model**: How will the open-source contribution process work?
2. **Release Cadence**: Is the proposed release schedule realistic?
3. **Community Engagement**: How do we build a community around this project?
4. **Success Metrics**: How do we measure if the project is succeeding?

### 🎯 Required Clarifications Before Coding

These MUST be resolved before implementation begins:

1. ~~**Exact First Task**: What specific component do we build first?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Follow sequence in groomed backlog (Project Setup → Error System → Core Traits)
   
2. ~~**Proof of Concept Scope**: What demonstrates the architecture works?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Agent + Tool + Basic Validation (MVP)

3. ~~**Quality Bar**: What's the standard for the first code?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Production-ready with comprehensive tests and documentation

4. ~~**External Dependencies**: Which external services do we integrate first?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: OpenAI via async-openai (expandable later)

5. ~~**Development Environment**: What's the standard dev setup?~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: VS Code devcontainers (team lead preference)

### 📋 Pre-Coding Checklist

### 📅 Planning Timeline

**Week 1-2** (Current):
- Document current understanding
- Identify all uncertainties
- List required decisions

**Week 3-4**:
- Resolve architectural questions
- Define MVP scope
- Design core interfaces

**Week 5-6**:
- Validate complete plan
- Create proof-of-concept designs
- Prepare development environment

**Decision Point**:
- Review complete plan
- Make go/no-go decision
- Document coding authorization

## Next Steps

1. **Review this planning status** with human collaborator
2. **Prioritize questions** that need immediate answers
3. **Schedule decision sessions** for critical choices
4. **Create proof-of-concept sketches** (pseudocode only)
5. **Validate assumptions** through research or prototypes

## Important Reminders

⚠️ **No implementation code** until explicit decision
⚠️ **Focus on clarity** over speed
⚠️ **Document all decisions** in context network
⚠️ **Maintain shared understanding** through communication
