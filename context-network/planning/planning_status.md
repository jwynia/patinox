# Planning Status

## Purpose
Track the current planning status and what needs to be resolved before implementation can begin.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Operational
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Current Planning Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Planning Items

- [x] Project vision and philosophy defined
- [x] Core architectural pattern selected (MAPE-K)
- [x] Technology stack researched and documented
- [x] 4-phase roadmap created
- [x] Modular crate structure designed
- [x] Safety principles established
- [x] Monitoring strategy outlined

### üîÑ In Progress Planning Items

- [ ] Validate architectural decisions with stakeholders
- [ ] Refine first milestone scope
- [ ] Define concrete MVP features
- [ ] Establish testing strategy
- [ ] Create detailed interface specifications

### ‚ùì Questions Requiring Answers

#### Architectural Questions
1. **MAPE-K Appropriateness**: Is the MAPE-K pattern the best choice for our self-adaptive system?
2. **Crate Boundaries**: Are the 9 proposed crates properly scoped? Should any be combined or split?
3. **Actor Model**: Is the actor model the right concurrency approach for agent communication?

#### Technical Questions
1. **Typestate Complexity**: Will typestate patterns make the API too complex for users?
2. **Tower Middleware**: How exactly will validators compose in the Tower stack?
3. **Performance Overhead**: What's the actual performance cost of embedded monitoring?
4. **LLM Abstraction**: How do we handle vastly different LLM provider capabilities?

#### Implementation Questions
1. **MVP Definition**: What's the absolute minimum feature set for a useful v0.1?
2. **Testing Strategy**: How do we test LLM-based validators effectively?
3. **Migration Path**: How do we make migration from LangChain/Mastra smooth?
4. **Documentation**: What examples and tutorials are essential from day one?

#### Process Questions
1. **Contribution Model**: How will the open-source contribution process work?
2. **Release Cadence**: Is the proposed release schedule realistic?
3. **Community Engagement**: How do we build a community around this project?
4. **Success Metrics**: How do we measure if the project is succeeding?

### üéØ Required Clarifications Before Coding

These MUST be resolved before implementation begins:

1. **Exact First Task**: What specific component do we build first?
   - Options: Core traits only? Basic agent with no validation? Minimal validator?
   
2. **Proof of Concept Scope**: What demonstrates the architecture works?
   - Options: Simple tool execution? Basic validation? Full MAPE-K loop?

3. **Quality Bar**: What's the standard for the first code?
   - Options: Prototype quality? Production-ready? Somewhere between?

4. **External Dependencies**: Which external services do we integrate first?
   - Options: OpenAI only? Multiple LLMs? Local models?

5. **Development Environment**: What's the standard dev setup?
   - Options: Docker-based? Native Rust? Dev containers?

### üìã Pre-Coding Checklist

Before we can begin coding, these must be complete:

- [ ] All architectural questions answered
- [ ] MVP scope precisely defined
- [ ] First milestone deliverables listed
- [ ] Success criteria established
- [ ] Development environment documented
- [ ] Testing approach determined
- [ ] Core interfaces designed
- [ ] Example use cases defined
- [ ] Human explicitly approves plan
- [ ] Begin coding decision documented

### üö¶ Readiness Assessment

**Overall Readiness**: 60%

| Area | Readiness | What's Needed |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Architecture | 75% | Validate pattern choices |
| Technical Design | 70% | Resolve typestate questions |
| Scope Definition | 40% | Define MVP precisely |
| Development Process | 50% | Setup dev environment |
| Testing Strategy | 30% | Define testing approach |
| Documentation | 65% | Create interface specs |

### üìÖ Planning Timeline

**Week 1-2** (Current):
- Document current understanding
- Identify all uncertainties
- List required decisions

**Week 3-4**:
- Resolve architectural questions
- Define MVP scope
- Design core interfaces

**Week 5-6**:
- Validate complete plan
- Create proof-of-concept designs
- Prepare development environment

**Decision Point**:
- Review complete plan
- Make go/no-go decision
- Document coding authorization

## Next Steps

1. **Review this planning status** with human collaborator
2. **Prioritize questions** that need immediate answers
3. **Schedule decision sessions** for critical choices
4. **Create proof-of-concept sketches** (pseudocode only)
5. **Validate assumptions** through research or prototypes

## Important Reminders

‚ö†Ô∏è **No implementation code** until explicit decision
‚ö†Ô∏è **Focus on clarity** over speed
‚ö†Ô∏è **Document all decisions** in context network
‚ö†Ô∏è **Maintain shared understanding** through communication
