# Task: Improve Test Error Consistency

**Created**: 2025-08-19 15:30 CDT
**Status**: Planned (deferred from code review recommendations)
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Test Quality / Technical Debt

## Overview

Replace remaining `.unwrap()` calls in test code with proper error handling for consistency with the PR's safety theme.

## Context from Code Review

**Original Recommendation**: "Some `.unwrap()` calls remain in tests: While not critical for test code, lines like `src/traits/monitor.rs:513` could use proper error handling for consistency with the PR's safety theme."

**Why Deferred**: While not critical, this is a medium-effort refactoring that affects multiple test files and should be done systematically rather than as quick fixes.

## Scope

### Files to Review:
- `src/traits/mod.rs` - Test modules
- `src/traits/monitor.rs` - Test utilities
- `src/traits/agent.rs` - Test assertions  
- `src/traits/validator.rs` - Test helpers
- `src/traits/tool.rs` - Test execution

### Pattern to Replace:
```rust
// Current pattern
let result = some_operation().unwrap();

// Preferred pattern for tests
let result = some_operation().expect("Clear description of what should succeed");
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All `.unwrap()` calls in test code replaced with `.expect()` with descriptive messages
- [ ] No change to test functionality or behavior
- [ ] All tests continue to pass
- [ ] Error messages provide clear context for debugging test failures
- [ ] Consistent error handling patterns across all test modules

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Audit and Catalog
- [ ] Search for all `.unwrap()` calls in test code
- [ ] Categorize by type (setup, assertions, cleanup)
- [ ] Identify any that are actually appropriate (rare edge cases)

### Phase 2: Systematic Replacement
- [ ] Replace setup `.unwrap()` calls with descriptive `.expect()` messages
- [ ] Replace assertion `.unwrap()` calls with test-specific context
- [ ] Maintain any `.unwrap()` calls that are testing panic conditions

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no behavior changes
- [ ] Verify error messages are helpful for debugging
- [ ] Check that test failure output is improved

## Examples

### Before:
```rust
let config = serde_json::from_str(&serialized).unwrap();
```

### After:
```rust  
let config = serde_json::from_str(&serialized)
    .expect("Serialized config should deserialize successfully");
```

## Estimated Effort

**Size**: Medium (affects multiple test files systematically)
**Timeline**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Low (test-only changes, no functional impact)

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies
- Can be done incrementally per module
- Should coordinate with any ongoing test refactoring work

## Related Context

- Builds on mutex error handling improvements from current PR
- Supports overall framework safety and reliability theme
- Aligns with professional development practices established
