### Critical Success Factors for Risk Management
1. **Early Testing**: Set up and test with actual LMStudio service immediately
2. **Pattern Adherence**: Follow established TDD and integration patterns strictly
3. **Documentation**: Capture insights and deviations as they're discovered
4. **Iterative Validation**: Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
5. **Flexibility**: Be prepared to adapt approach based on discovered issues

## Risk-Adjusted Implementation Strategy

- Monitor performance impact

### Phase 4 Risk Mitigation Focus
- Comprehensive integration testing with various configurations

## Emergency Contingencies

### If OpenAI API Compatibility Fails
1. **Fallback Plan**: Switch to custom LMStudio API format (similar to Ollama approach)
2. **Estimated Impact**: +2-3 hours additional development time
3. **Decision Point**: If more than 50% of API calls require custom handling

### If Service Discovery Integration Fails
1. **Fallback Plan**: Manual configuration only (no automatic discovery)
2. **Estimated Impact**: Reduced user experience, +1 hour documentation time
3. **Decision Point**: If service discovery patterns don't work after reasonable effort

### If TDD Pattern Doesn't Fit
1. **Fallback Plan**: Adapt testing approach while maintaining quality standards
2. **Estimated Impact**: Pattern documentation updates, +1-2 hours
3. **Decision Point**: If test complexity becomes prohibitive

## Risk Review Schedule

- **Weekly Check-ins**: During active implementation
