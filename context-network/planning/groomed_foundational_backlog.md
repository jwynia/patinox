- [ ] Standard `.gitignore` for Rust projects
- [ ] `README.md` with project description and build instructions
- [ ] Development dependencies configured (dev-dependencies)
- [ ] Basic clippy and rustfmt configuration

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Create root `Cargo.toml` with workspace configuration
2. Create `patinox-core` subdirectory with basic crate structure  
3. Add standard Rust `.gitignore`
4. Pin Rust toolchain version in `rust-toolchain.toml`
5. Create basic GitHub Actions CI pipeline
6. Configure clippy lints and rustfmt
7. Write minimal `README.md`
8. Verify everything builds with `cargo check --workspace`

**Watch Out For**:
- Follow the modular crate structure from foundation/structure.md
- Don't over-engineer CI - keep it simple initially
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds

### 1. Create Core Error Type Hierarchy
**One-liner**: Establish the foundational error system with recovery strategies for all Patinox components
**Sequence**: Second - depends on project setup (#0), everything else depends on this
**Files to modify**: 
- `src/error.rs` (new)
- `src/lib.rs`
- `Cargo.toml` (add thiserror, anyhow)

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: All other foundational components depend on having proper error types. This is the absolute first step in the utility-first approach.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `PatinoxError` enum covers Validation, Execution, Network, Configuration categories
- [ ] All errors implement `std::error::Error` trait chain correctly
- [ ] `recovery_strategy()` method returns appropriate `RecoveryStrategy` enum
- [ ] Error context is preserved through the chain
- [ ] Integration with `thiserror` for derive macros
- [ ] Integration with `anyhow` for application-level usage
- [ ] All public error types are documented with examples
- [ ] Property-based tests verify error handling never panics

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Create `patinox-core` crate with basic structure
2. Define `PatinoxError` enum with main categories
3. Define `RecoveryStrategy` enum (Retry, Fallback, CircuitBreak, Fail)
4. Implement `recovery_strategy()` method with exhaustive match
5. Add `thiserror` derives for clean error definitions
6. Write comprehensive unit tests following TDD
7. Add property-based tests with `proptest`
8. Document all public APIs with examples

**Watch Out For**: 
- Don't over-engineer - start simple and expand
- Ensure error chains preserve original cause
- Test all error conversion paths

### 2. Define Core Trait Interfaces
**One-liner**: Create the fundamental `Agent`, `Tool`, `Validator`, and `Monitor` traits that form Patinox's architecture
**Sequence**: Third - depends on project setup (#0) and error system (#1), enables all other work
**Files to modify**:
- `src/traits/agent.rs` (new)
- `src/traits/tool.rs` (new) 
- `src/traits/validator.rs` (new)
- `src/traits/monitor.rs` (new)
- `src/traits/mod.rs` (new)

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: These traits define the contract for all Patinox components. They must be object-safe for dynamic dispatch and support async execution.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `Agent` trait with lifecycle methods (start, stop, execute)
- [ ] `Tool` trait with async execution and metadata
- [ ] `Validator` trait compatible with Tower middleware
- [ ] `Monitor` trait with telemetry hooks
- [ ] All traits are object-safe (`Box<dyn Trait>` compiles)
- [ ] All traits support `Send + Sync` for multi-threading
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation with usage examples
- [ ] Mock implementations for testing
- [ ] Integration with error types from task #1

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Start with `Agent` trait - basic lifecycle and execution
2. Define `Tool` trait with async execute method
3. Create `Validator` trait compatible with Tower's `Service` trait
4. Design `Monitor` trait for telemetry collection
5. Ensure all traits are object-safe (no `Self` in return types)
6. Add `async_trait` where needed for async methods
7. Create mock implementations using `mockall`
8. Write trait object safety tests

**Watch Out For**:
- Object safety restrictions (no associated types with `Self`)
- Async trait methods need `async_trait` macro
- Keep interfaces minimal - can extend later

- `src/builder.rs` (new)
- Examples showing usage patterns

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Rust's type system can prevent many runtime errors. This infrastructure enables compile-time guarantees for agent states and configuration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Typestate pattern for agent lifecycle (Created -> Started -> Running -> Stopped)
- [ ] Builder pattern for agent configuration with required fields
- [ ] Phantom types for compile-time validation
- [ ] Examples demonstrating invalid states don't compile
- [ ] Documentation explaining the patterns
- [ ] Tests showing type safety works as expected

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Define typestate marker types for agent states
2. Create generic `Agent<State>` struct
3. Implement state transitions with consuming methods
4. Build configuration builder with required/optional fields
5. Use phantom types for compile-time checks
6. Add comprehensive examples and tests
7. Document when to use each pattern

**Watch Out For**:
- Don't make the API too complex for simple use cases
- Provide escape hatches for advanced users
- Balance safety with ergonomics

## ⏳ Ready Soon (Blocked)

### LLM Provider Abstraction
**Sequence**: Sixth - requires traits (#2), can start design work now
**Blocker**: Awaiting decision on first provider to implement (OpenAI vs OpenRouter)
**Prep work possible**: Design the trait interface and error types

### Configuration System Implementation
**Sequence**: Seventh - can be done in parallel with #6, requires error system (#1)
**Blocker**: Awaiting decision on secret management approach
**Prep work possible**: Implement basic config loading without secrets

### Basic Agent Implementation  
**Sequence**: Eighth - requires error system (#1), traits (#2), and provider (#6)
**Blocker**: Needs core infrastructure completed first
**Prep work possible**: Design agent state machine and execution flow

## 🔍 Needs Decisions

### Testing Framework Integration
**Decision needed**: Which mocking approach for LLM testing?
**Options**: 
- `mockall` for trait-based mocking (recommended)
- `wiremock` for HTTP-level mocking  
- Custom test doubles
**Recommendation**: Start with `mockall` for unit tests, add `wiremock` for integration tests

### Development Environment Setup
**Decision needed**: Docker-based dev environment or native Rust?
**Options**:
- Dev containers with all dependencies
- Native development with installation scripts
- Hybrid approach
**Recommendation**: Native first, add containers later for consistency

### First Example/Demo
**Decision needed**: What should the first working example demonstrate?
**Options**:
- Simple "hello world" agent
- Tool execution example  
- Validation pipeline demo
**Recommendation**: Simple agent that executes one tool with validation

## 🗑️ Archived Tasks
