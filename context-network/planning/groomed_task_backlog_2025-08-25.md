*Generated by Task Grooming Specialist after comprehensive context network analysis*
*Updated 2025-09-17: Post-Streaming Implementation*

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed

### 1. ~~Streaming Support Implementation~~ (COMPLETED 2025-09-17)
**Status**: Complete with comprehensive TDD implementation
**Outcome**: 8 streaming tests passing, both Ollama and LMStudio providers support streaming
**Follow-up Tasks**: 6 improvement tasks created (Task-006 through Task-011)
**Documentation**: [Task Completion Record](../records/task-completion-streaming-support-2025-09-17.md)

## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. LMStudio Provider Implementation Using TDD Methodology
**One-liner**: Apply proven TDD patterns from Ollama implementation to complete LMStudio provider, validating pattern reusability  
**Effort**: Large (4-6 hours)  
**Priority**: High  
**Risk**: Medium  
**Files to modify**: 
- `src/provider/local/lmstudio.rs` (upgrade from 81-line stubs)
- `tests/local_provider_test.rs` (add comprehensive test module)

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: With Ollama provider successfully completed using comprehensive TDD methodology, we can now validate the reusability of established patterns by applying them to LMStudio. This completes the local provider ecosystem.

**Strategic Value**:
- Pattern validation: Proves TDD methodology scales across provider types
- Ecosystem completion: Completes major local LLM support (Ollama + LMStudio)
- Knowledge refinement: Will identify any gaps in documented patterns

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Follow **[TDD Provider Implementation Pattern](../implementation/tdd-provider-implementation-pattern.md)** exactly
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite BEFORE any implementation code (15+ tests minimum)
- [ ] Apply **[Provider HTTP Error Mapping Guide](../implementation/provider-http-error-mapping-guide.md)** patterns
- [ ] Use **[Local Provider Integration Patterns](../discovery/2025-08-23-001-local-provider-integration-patterns.md)** insights
- [ ] Complete LMStudio API integration (OpenAI-compatible endpoints)
- [ ] Achieve similar test coverage to Ollama provider (17 tests)

**Implementation Guide**:
1. **Phase 1: TDD Setup** - Design test structure following established pattern
2. **Phase 2: Error Mapping** - Apply standard HTTP error handling
3. **Phase 3: API Integration** - Implement OpenAI-compatible endpoints  
4. **Phase 4: Integration Tests** - Add service availability tests

**Dependencies**: 
- TDD Provider Implementation Pattern (‚úÖ documented)
- Error Mapping Guide (‚úÖ documented)
- Local Provider Integration Patterns (‚úÖ documented)

**Watch Out For**: 
- LMStudio uses OpenAI-compatible API (different from Ollama's custom endpoints)
- Service discovery integration needs to handle port differences
- Test organization should separate unit from integration tests

### ‚úÖ 2. ~~Create Provider Testing Utilities~~ (COMPLETED)
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2025-09-15)
**One-liner**: Extract common testing patterns from 4 provider implementations into reusable utilities to accelerate future development
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours) - **Actual**: 4 hours
**Priority**: High
**Risk**: Low
**Files completed**:
- ‚úÖ `tests/utils/mod.rs` (367 lines - comprehensive utility implementation)
- ‚úÖ `tests/provider_test_utils_test.rs` (test suite for utilities)
- ‚úÖ `tests/provider_test_utils_demo.rs` (demonstration examples)

**Completion Evidence**:
- **Achievement**: 46.7% code reduction in provider tests (exceeded 40% target)
- **Test Coverage**: 27 comprehensive tests for all utility functions
- **Git**: Merged via PR #13 (commit 2bf0a5d)
- **Documentation**: Complete retrospective at `meta/retrospective-2025-09-15-provider-testing-utilities.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Analysis of OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and Ollama provider tests reveals significant boilerplate code duplication. Creating shared utilities will reduce future development time by 30-50%.

**Boilerplate Patterns Identified**:
- Service-unavailable error handling test patterns
- Provider creation and configuration testing
- Request validation test patterns
- Mock HTTP client setup for unit tests
- Integration test annotation patterns

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create `ProviderTestUtils` with common test patterns
- [ ] Abstract service-unavailable error testing pattern
- [ ] Create mock HTTP client builders for unit testing
- [ ] Standardize integration test annotation patterns
- [ ] Provide request validation test helpers

**Implementation Guide**:
1. **Phase 1: Pattern Analysis** - Review all provider test suites for common patterns
2. **Phase 2: Utility Design** - Create clean, ergonomic testing utility API
3. **Phase 3: Implementation** - Build utilities with generic trait support
4. **Phase 4: Validation** - Apply utilities to existing providers to verify effectiveness

**Expected Benefits**:
- 30-50% reduction in test code duplication
- Consistent testing approaches across all providers
- Faster development of new provider tests

**Watch Out For**:
- API must work with different provider types (local vs cloud)
- Utilities should enhance, not replace manual testing capability
- Need backwards compatibility with existing tests

### 3. Extract Common HTTP Request Logic (Ollama Provider)
**One-liner**: Remove duplicate URL formatting and error handling code between GET/POST methods in Ollama provider  
**Effort**: Small (30-45 minutes)  
**Priority**: High  
**Risk**: Medium  
**Files to modify**:
- `src/provider/local/ollama.rs` (refactor lines ~114-170)

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Code review identified ~40 lines of duplicate code between `make_request()` and `make_post_request()` methods, violating DRY principle and creating maintenance overhead.

**Duplication Identified**:
- URL formatting: `format!("{}{}", self.base_url, path)` repeated
- Error handling patterns duplicated across both methods  
- Response processing logic nearly identical
- Status code checking repeated

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Extract common request handling logic into `execute_request` helper method
- [ ] Eliminate duplicate URL formatting code
- [ ] Consolidate error handling patterns
- [ ] Maintain existing API surface unchanged (no breaking changes)
- [ ] All 17 Ollama tests continue to pass

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Create generic `execute_request()` method handling common logic
2. Update `make_request()` to use new helper for GET requests
3. Update `make_post_request()` to use new helper for POST requests
4. Run tests to ensure no regression

**Watch Out For**:
- Generic method must handle both GET and POST request types
- Error handling must remain identical to current behavior
- Performance should not degrade

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Low-Priority Optimizations)

### Implement Model Caching System (Ollama Provider)
**Effort**: Medium (45-60 minutes)  
**Priority**: High  
**Blocker**: Should complete after common HTTP logic extraction  
**Prep work possible**: Design cache invalidation strategy

**Context**: Ollama provider has unused `model_cache` field and makes redundant `/api/tags` calls in `supports_model()` and `model_capabilities()` methods.

---

### Optimize String Allocations (Ollama Provider)  
**Effort**: Small (15-30 minutes)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Blocker**: Should complete after HTTP logic and caching optimizations  
**Prep work possible**: Identify all allocation hot spots

**Context**: Several unnecessary string allocations identified in model ID creation and request building.

---

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Implement Tool Support for Anthropic Provider
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Large (2-3 days)  
**Decision needed**: Should this be prioritized over provider ecosystem completion?  
**Options**: 
- **Option A**: Complete local provider ecosystem first (LMStudio), then tool support
- **Option B**: Implement tool support immediately for Anthropic provider  
**Recommendation**: Option A - Complete provider ecosystem for consistency, then tackle tool support as dedicated project
