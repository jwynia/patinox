   - Create threat model for security
   - Define testing strategy

2. **Short-term Actions** (During Phase 1):
   - Design state persistence
   - Create cost management framework
   - Document deployment patterns

3. **Medium-term Actions** (During Phase 2-3):
   - Design plugin architecture
   - Plan distributed system support
   - Establish documentation practices

4. **Long-term Actions** (Phase 4 and beyond):
   - Implement remaining areas
   - Refine based on production experience
   - Evolve with community needs

## Dependencies

Many of these areas are interconnected:
- Multi-tenancy affects state persistence, security, and cost management
- Plugin system affects versioning and documentation
- Distributed systems affect debugging and deployment
- Security affects all areas

## Risk Assessment

**Highest Risk Areas**:
1. **Security**: Vulnerabilities could be catastrophic
2. **Multi-tenancy**: Wrong design is hard to fix later
3. **State Persistence**: Data loss is unacceptable
4. **Testing**: Poor quality affects everything

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Address high-risk areas first
- Get expert review for critical decisions
- Prototype risky areas early
- Plan for iterative refinement

## Conclusion

These unaddressed areas represent significant architectural decisions that should be considered before implementation begins. While not all need immediate resolution, having a plan for each ensures the project can evolve sustainably and meet production requirements.
