# Ready for Implementation

Tasks that are fully groomed, have no blockers, and are ready to be worked on immediately.

## What Makes a Task "Ready"?

A task is ready when:
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are clearly defined
- ✅ All dependencies are completed or resolved
- ✅ No open questions or decisions needed
- ✅ Estimated effort is reasonable
- ✅ Implementation approach is documented
- ✅ Someone can start within 5 minutes of reading

## Current Phase: V2 Layer 2 - Real Usage & Pain-Driven Plugins

**Context**: Layer 1 (Minimal Agent) completed October 12, 2025. Now building real agents to identify what plugins are actually needed.

**See**: [planning/v2-week-2-plan.md](../../planning/v2-week-2-plan.md) for full Week 2 strategy.

## Week 2 Phase 2: Build Real Agents (Days 3-5)

*Tasks will be added after Phase 1 completes and we can identify actual use cases*

**Candidates** (not yet groomed):
- File processor agent
- Git helper agent
- Documentation generator agent

**Approach**: Pick 2 based on immediate utility, build them, document every pain point.

**Last updated by**: Provider integration completed
**Total ready tasks**: 0
**V2 Phase**: Layer 2 - Week 2, Phase 1 Complete

## Notes

This is a fresh V2 backlog. Previous V1 refinement tasks (streaming optimization, validation improvements, etc.) were deleted to avoid "pink elephant" effect.

**V2 Principle**: Tasks are added **only after pain is felt** through real usage. We don't plan sophistication in advance.

**Next tasks emerge from**:
- Building 2-3 real agents (Week 2, Days 3-5)
- Documenting pain points during building
- Pain point analysis (Week 2, Day 6)

See [planning/v2-week-2-plan.md](../../planning/v2-week-2-plan.md) for the emergence strategy.
