# Ready for Implementation

Tasks that are fully groomed, have no blockers, and are ready to be worked on immediately.

## What Makes a Task "Ready"?

A task is ready when:
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are clearly defined
- ✅ All dependencies are completed or resolved
- ✅ No open questions or decisions needed
- ✅ Estimated effort is reasonable (not "unknown")
- ✅ Implementation approach is documented
- ✅ Someone can start within 5 minutes of reading

## How to Use This File

## Notes

This backlog was initialized as part of the status-based structure migration (see [decisions/backlog-structure-migration-2025-10-12.md](../../decisions/backlog-structure-migration-2025-10-12.md)).

Tasks will be populated here after running `/groom` on existing task inventory.
