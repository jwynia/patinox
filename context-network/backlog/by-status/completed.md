# Recently Completed Tasks

Tasks completed in the current sprint or recent period (last 14 days).

## Purpose

This file provides:
- ✅ Quick reference for recently completed work
- ✅ Sprint velocity tracking
- ✅ "What got done this week?" visibility
- ✅ Accomplishment tracking

## Archival Policy

Tasks are moved from this file to `../archived/YYYY-MM/` at the end of each sprint or monthly, whichever comes first. This keeps this file focused on recent accomplishments.

## How to Use This File

**For retrospectives**: Review what was accomplished
**For velocity**: Count completed tasks per sprint
**For sync**: Auto-updated by `/sync` command when detecting completions
**For celebration**: See progress made!
