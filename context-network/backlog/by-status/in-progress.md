# In Progress

Tasks currently being actively worked on by team members.

## What Makes a Task "In Progress"?

A task is in progress when:
- ✅ Someone has started implementation
- ✅ Feature branch exists
- ✅ Commits have been made
- ⏳ Work is ongoing
- ⏳ Not yet ready for review

## Transition Rules

- **Ready** → **In Progress**: When `/implement [TASK-ID]` is run
- **In Progress** → **Completed**: When PR is merged or work is done
- **In Progress** → **Ready**: If work is paused/abandoned (with notes)

## WIP Limits

Recommended work-in-progress limits:
- **Per person**: 1-2 tasks maximum
- **Team total**: Depends on team size

Too many in-progress tasks indicates:
- ⚠️ Context switching
- ⚠️ Blocked work not being addressed
- ⚠️ Tasks larger than estimated
