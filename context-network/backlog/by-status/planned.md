# Planned Tasks

Tasks that have been groomed and understood, but have dependencies or blockers preventing immediate work.

## What Makes a Task "Planned"?

A task is planned when:
- ✅ Requirements are documented
- ✅ Acceptance criteria defined
- ✅ Dependencies identified
- ⏳ Waiting on prerequisite tasks
- ⏳ Waiting on decisions or approvals
- ⏳ Waiting on external factors

## Transition to "Ready"

Tasks move from **Planned** → **Ready** when:
- All blocking tasks are completed
- All required decisions are made
- All external dependencies are resolved
- No other impediments remain
