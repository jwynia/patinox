## Grooming Request
$ARGUMENTS

## Command Options

Parse $ARGUMENTS for options:
- `--ready-only` - Only show tasks that are ready for implementation
- `--blocked` - Focus on identifying and unblocking blocked tasks
- `--stale [days]` - Re-groom tasks older than specified days
- `--domain [name]` - Groom tasks for specific domain only
- `--complexity [trivial|small|medium|large]` - Filter by complexity level
- `--generate-sprint` - Create a sprint plan from groomed tasks
- `--no-sync-check` - Skip sync integration phase (Phase 0)
- `--force-sync-conflicts` - Groom conflicted tasks anyway (mark as needs-review)
- `--sync-state-only` - Only process tasks mentioned in sync state file

## Grooming Process

### Phase 0: Sync Integration & Reality Check (NEW)

**Load Sync State Data**:
```javascript
// Check for sync state file
const syncStatePath = 'context-network/meta/sync-state.json';
const syncState = loadSyncState(syncStatePath);

if (syncState && isRecentSync(syncState.metadata.lastSyncRun)) {
  console.log(`Using sync data from ${syncState.metadata.lastSyncRun}`);
  console.log(`Sync found ${Object.keys(syncState.completedTasks).length} completed tasks`);
} else {
  console.warn('No recent sync data found. Consider running: /sync --groom-prep');
}
```

**Pre-Filter Tasks Based on Sync Findings**:

1. **Skip Sync-Confirmed Completions**:
   ```markdown
   ## Tasks Filtered Out (Sync-Confirmed Complete)
   
   ### High Confidence Completions - Skipped
   - ~~Implement telemetry configuration~~ ‚úÖ
     - **Evidence**: FileExporter + Mastra integration complete
     - **Action**: Archived, no grooming needed
     - **Follow-up**: Documentation task auto-generated
   
   ### Medium Confidence - Flagged for Quick Verification
   - Database migration system (needs 30-second verification)
     - **Sync evidence**: Custom scripts found vs. planned Prisma
     - **Action**: Quick check before proceeding with grooming
   ```

2. **Handle Partial Implementations**:
   ```markdown
   ## Tasks Updated Based on Sync Findings
   
   ### Scope Adjustments
   - **Original**: "Build user authentication system"
   - **Sync findings**: Login/logout complete, password reset missing
   - **Updated scope**: "Complete user authentication - password reset only"
   - **Reduced complexity**: Large ‚Üí Small
   ```

3. **Flag Conflicts for Manual Review**:
   ```markdown
   ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Sync Conflicts Requiring Manual Review
   
   ### Before Grooming These Tasks
   - **Task**: API rate limiting
   - **Conflict**: Plan shows "not started" but sync found middleware
   - **Required action**: Verify actual implementation status
   - **Grooming blocked until**: Conflict resolved
   ```

4. **Add New Tasks from Sync Discoveries**:
   ```markdown
   ## New Tasks Discovered by Sync
   
   ### Documentation Tasks (Auto-Generated)
   - Document telemetry configuration options
     - **Priority**: Medium
     - **Reason**: Implementation complete but undocumented
     - **Complexity**: Small (3-4 hours)
   
   ### Follow-up Tasks  
   - Refactor duplicate authentication middleware
     - **Priority**: Low
     - **Reason**: Sync found two implementations of same feature
     - **Complexity**: Medium (clean up technical debt)
   ```

**Generate Pre-Groom Report**:
```markdown
# Pre-Groom Sync Integration Report

## Summary
- Tasks scanned: 47
- Filtered out (complete): 8
- Scope updated (partial): 3  
- Conflicts requiring review: 2
- New tasks added: 5

## Ready for Grooming: 34 tasks
- High priority: 8
- Medium priority: 18
- Low priority: 8

## Actions Required Before Grooming
- [ ] Review conflict: API rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Verify partial: User authentication password reset
- [ ] Confirm completion: Database migration approach

## Sync Integration Quality
‚úÖ Recent sync data available (2 hours old)
‚úÖ High confidence completions filtered out  
‚úÖ Partial implementations scope-adjusted
‚ö†Ô∏è 2 conflicts need manual resolution
```

**Adjust Grooming Scope**:
- Focus remaining phases on tasks that actually need work
- Skip redundant analysis of sync-confirmed completions
- Prioritize resolving sync-identified conflicts
- Include auto-generated follow-up tasks in grooming

### Phase 1: Task Inventory & Classification

**Scan all task sources:**
- `/planning/sprint-*.md`
- `/planning/backlog.md`
- `/tasks/**/*.md`
- `/decisions/**/*.md` (for follow-up actions)
- `/domains/**/todo.md`
- Files with "TODO:", "NEXT:", "PLANNED:" markers

**Classify each task as:**
- **A: Claimed Complete** - Marked done but needs follow-up
- **B: Ready to Execute** - Clear criteria, no blockers
- **C: Needs Grooming** - Vague requirements or missing context
- **D: Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies or decisions
- **E: Obsolete** - No longer relevant or duplicate

### Phase 2: Reality Check

For each task, assess:
- **Still Needed?** Check against current project state
- **Prerequisites Met?** Identify missing dependencies
- **Implementation Clear?** Flag ambiguities
- **Success Criteria Defined?** Note what's missing
- **Complexity Estimate:** Trivial/Small/Medium/Large/Unknown

### Phase 3: Task Enhancement

Transform vague tasks into actionable items with:
- Specific, measurable title
- Clear context and rationale
- Input/output specifications
- Acceptance criteria checklist
- Implementation notes
- Identified dependencies
- Effort estimate
- Related documentation links

### Phase 4: Dependency Analysis

Create dependency map showing:
- Tasks ready now (no dependencies)
- Tasks ready after current work
- Blocked chains with specific blockers
- Decision points needed

### Phase 5: Priority Scoring

Score tasks based on:
- User value (High/Medium/Low)
- Technical risk (High/Medium/Low)
- Effort (Trivial/Small/Medium/Large)
- Dependencies (None/Few/Many)
- Calculate priority score and readiness status

### Phase 6: Generate Groomed Backlog

## Output Format

```markdown
# Groomed Task Backlog - [Date]

## üìä Sync Integration Summary (NEW)
**Sync State**: ‚úÖ Fresh (2 hours old) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Stale (2+ days) | ‚ùå Missing

```

## Red Flags to Identify

### Traditional Red Flags
- Task has been "almost ready" for multiple sprints
- No one can explain what "done" looks like
- "Just refactor X" - usually hides complexity
- Dependencies on "ongoing discussions"
- Task title contains "and" - should be split
- "Investigate/Research X" without concrete output
- References outdated architecture
- Everyone avoids picking it up

### Sync Integration Red Flags (NEW)
- **Stale sync data**: Grooming without recent sync (>3 days old)
- **Ignored conflicts**: Proceeding with tasks that have sync conflicts
- **Duplicate work**: Grooming tasks sync already confirmed complete
- **Missing follow-ups**: Sync found implementations but no documentation tasks
- **Scope mismatch**: Task complexity doesn't match sync findings (e.g., "Large" task but sync shows 90% complete)

## Quality Checklist for Groomed Tasks

A well-groomed task should allow a developer to:

### Traditional Quality Criteria
- Start within 5 minutes of reading
- Know exactly what success looks like
- Understand the "why" without extensive background
- Find all referenced files and documentation
- Have realistic complexity estimates
- See all dependencies explicitly listed
- Know the obvious first step

### Sync Integration Quality Criteria (NEW)
- **Reality-aligned**: Not duplicate work already completed
- **Scope-accurate**: Complexity matches actual remaining work (per sync)
- **Conflict-free**: No unresolved sync vs. plan mismatches
- **Evidence-aware**: References sync findings where relevant
- **Follow-up complete**: Includes documentation/cleanup for sync-detected implementations

## Enhanced Workflow Integration

**Recommended Command Sequence**:
```bash
/sync --groom-prep      # Update reality state, prepare for grooming
/groom                  # Reality-aware backlog grooming  
/groom --generate-sprint # Create sprint from filtered backlog
```

**Benefits of Integration**:
- ‚úÖ Eliminates grooming already-complete work
- ‚úÖ Accurate complexity estimates based on actual progress
- ‚úÖ Automatic generation of follow-up tasks (docs, cleanup)
- ‚úÖ Early identification of scope/plan conflicts
- ‚úÖ Focus team effort on work that actually needs doing

Remember: The goal is to transform a messy backlog into a prioritized, **reality-aligned** list of actionable work items that reflect the actual project state, not just the planned state.
