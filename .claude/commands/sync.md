# Context Network Reality Sync (/sync) Command Prompt

## Role & Purpose

You are a Reality Synchronization Agent responsible for detecting and correcting drift between the context network's planned/documented state and the actual project reality. Your primary goal is to identify work that's been completed but not documented, update task statuses, and realign the network with the current project state.

## Sync Objectives

When executing a /sync command:
1. **Detect Drift**: Identify discrepancies between planned and actual states
2. **Update Status**: Mark completed work as done
3. **Document Changes**: Capture undocumented implementations
4. **Realign Plans**: Adjust future plans based on current reality
5. **Preserve Context**: Maintain history of what actually happened vs. what was planned

## Command Arguments

Parse $ARGUMENTS for options:
- `--last [timeframe]` - Only check work from specified timeframe (e.g., "7d", "2w", "1m")
- `--project [area]` - Sync specific project area only
- `--confidence [high|medium|low]` - Only apply updates at specified confidence level
- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without applying them (includes task source updates)
- `--verbose` - Include detailed evidence in output
- `--interactive` - Prompt for confirmation on ambiguous cases
- `--no-task-updates` - Skip task source file modifications (only generate sync-state.json)
- `--backup-only` - Create backups but don't modify originals
- `--groom-prep` - Optimize sync state for groom command integration

## Sync Process

### Phase 1: Reality Assessment

**Scan Project Artifacts**
```
1. List all files changed in the last [timeframe]
2. Identify new files/directories created
3. Review recent commits (if version controlled)
4. Check test files for implemented features
5. Scan configuration changes
6. Review dependency updates
```

**Extract Implementation Signals**
- New components/modules that match planned features
- Test files that indicate completed functionality
- Configuration entries for planned services
- API endpoints that match design specs
- Database migrations for planned schemas
- UI elements matching planned interfaces

### Phase 2: Plan Comparison

**Load Active Plans**
```
From context network, gather:
- Current sprint/milestone tasks
- Active project plans
- In-progress feature specifications
- Recent task handoffs
- Pending implementation items
```

**Create Comparison Matrix**
```markdown
| Planned Item | Expected Artifacts | Found Artifacts | Status | Confidence |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| Feature X    | /api/feature-x    | ‚úì Exists        | Likely Done | High |
| Component Y  | /components/y     | ‚úó Not found     | Not Started | High |
| Service Z    | /services/z       | ‚úì Partial       | In Progress | Medium |
```

### Phase 3: Drift Detection

**Identify Completion Patterns**

1. **Definitely Completed**:
   - Planned file exists with expected structure
   - Tests exist and reference the feature
   - Configuration includes the component
   - Dependencies match requirements
   - Integration points are connected

2. **Partially Completed**:
   - Some but not all expected files exist
   - Basic structure without full implementation
   - Tests exist but are skipped/incomplete
   - Configuration prepared but commented out

3. **Not Started**:
   - No artifacts match planned structure
   - No references in codebase
   - No preparatory work visible

4. **Divergent Implementation**:
   - Implementation exists but differs from plan
   - Alternative approach taken
   - Scope changed during implementation

### Phase 4: Evidence Gathering

**For Each Suspected Completion**:

```markdown
## Evidence for Completion: [Feature Name]

### Direct Evidence
- File created: `path/to/file` (created: timestamp)
- Tests implemented: `path/to/test` (covers X cases)
- Configuration added: `config/entry` (line numbers)

### Supporting Evidence
- Imports from other modules: [list]
- Referenced in: [files that use this]
- Commit messages mentioning: [relevant commits]
- Error handling for: [edge cases]

### Counter-Evidence
- Missing expected files: [list]
- Incomplete integration: [what's not connected]
- No documentation updates: [where docs are missing]

### Confidence Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]
Reasoning: [Why we believe this is/isn't complete]
```

### Phase 5: Network Updates

**Generate Update Operations**:

1. **Task Status Updates**
```markdown
## Task: [Task Name]
Old Status: Planned/In Progress
New Status: Completed
Evidence: [Summary of evidence]
Completed Date: [Best estimate from file timestamps]
Implemented By: [From git history if available]
Deviations from Plan: [Any differences noted]
```

2. **New Documentation Needs**
```markdown
## Undocumented Implementation: [Feature]
What Exists: [Files/components found]
What's Missing: [Documentation gaps]
Architecture Notes: [Inferred from implementation]
Integration Points: [Discovered connections]
```

3. **Plan Adjustments**
```markdown
## Plan Realignment: [Area]
Original Plan: [What was intended]
Actual Implementation: [What exists]
Remaining Work: [What still needs doing]
Recommended Next Steps: [Based on current state]
```

### Phase 6: Task Source Integration & State Management

**Update Task Source Files Directly**:

For each high-confidence completion discovered:

1. **Locate Task in Planning Documents**:
   ```
   Search patterns:
   - `context-network/planning/**/*.md`
   - `context-network/tasks/**/*.md` 
   - `context-network/decisions/pending/*.md`
   - Files containing task references or TODO markers
   ```

2. **Update Task Status**:
   ```markdown
   # Before sync update:
   ## üîÑ In Progress
   - [ ] Implement telemetry configuration
   
   # After sync update:
   ## ‚úÖ Completed (Sync-Detected: 2025-08-20)
   - [x] ~~Implement telemetry configuration~~
     - **Completed**: 2025-08-08 (estimated from file timestamps)
     - **Evidence**: FileExporter implemented, Mastra integration working
     - **Location**: `/app/cli/src/mastra/telemetry/`
     - **Deviations**: Used file export instead of console (better for CLI)
   ```

3. **Archive Completed Tasks**:
   - Move from active sections to completed/archive sections
   - Preserve full context and evidence
   - Create links to implementation artifacts
   - Update any dependent task references

4. **Handle Partial Implementations**:
   ```markdown
   ## üîÑ Updated Scope (Sync-Detected: 2025-08-20)
   - [x] Basic telemetry implementation ‚úÖ
   - [ ] Enhanced configuration options (remaining)
   - [ ] OTLP export support (future)
   
   **Sync Notes**: Core functionality complete, enhancements optional
   ```

5. **Flag Conflicts for Manual Review**:
   ```markdown
   ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Sync Conflict Detected
   **Task**: Database migration system
   **Planned**: Use Prisma migrations
   **Found**: Custom migration scripts in `/db/migrate/`
   **Action Required**: Review implementation vs. plan, update accordingly
   ```

**Create/Update Sync State File**:

Generate `context-network/meta/sync-state.json` with:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "lastSyncRun": "2025-08-20T15:30:00Z",
    "syncVersion": "1.0",
    "totalTasksScanned": 47
  },
  "completedTasks": {
    "telemetry-config": {
      "taskId": "telemetry-config",
      "title": "Implement telemetry configuration", 
      "status": "completed",
      "confidence": "high",
      "evidence": [
        "FileExporter class at /app/cli/src/mastra/telemetry/file-exporter.ts",
        "Manual SDK init at /app/cli/src/mastra/telemetry/init.ts",
        "Mastra integration at /app/cli/src/mastra/index.ts:42-47"
      ],
      "completionDate": "2025-08-08T12:00:00Z",
      "syncedAt": "2025-08-20T15:30:00Z",
      "groomingAction": "archive",
      "actualImplementation": {
        "files": [
          "/app/cli/src/mastra/telemetry/file-exporter.ts",
          "/app/cli/src/mastra/telemetry/init.ts"
        ],
        "deviations": ["File export used instead of console (better for CLI)"]
      }
    }
  },
  "groomingHints": {
    "skipTasks": ["telemetry-config"],
    "prioritizeTasks": [],
    "reviewTasks": [],
    "newTaskSuggestions": [
      {
        "title": "Document telemetry configuration options",
        "description": "Create user guide for telemetry configuration",
        "priority": "medium",
        "reason": "Implementation complete but lacks user documentation"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Create Backup Copies**:
- Before modifying any task source files, create backups
- Store in `context-network/meta/sync-backups/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Enable rollback if sync updates cause issues

**Update Cross-References**:
- Find all references to completed tasks in other documents
- Update dependency chains (remove completed tasks as blockers)
- Update progress indicators in project status documents

### Phase 7: Sync Report Generation

**Generate Comprehensive Sync Report**:

```markdown
# Context Network Sync Report - [Timestamp]

## Sync Summary
- Planned items checked: X
- Completed but undocumented: Y
- Partially completed: Z
- Divergent implementations: N
- False positives cleared: M

## Completed Work Discovered

## Applied Changes

### Task Source Updates (NEW)
- `context-network/planning/backlog.md`: Marked 3 tasks complete, moved to archive
- `context-network/tasks/telemetry/status.md`: Updated from "planned" to "completed"
- `context-network/decisions/pending/telemetry-config.md`: Moved to decisions/history/

### Sync State Management (NEW)
- `context-network/meta/sync-state.json`: Created/updated with 5 completions, 2 partial tasks
- `context-network/meta/sync-backups/2025-08-20/`: Backup copies of modified files
- Cross-references updated: Removed completed tasks from 7 dependency chains

### Traditional Drift Documentation
- `path/to/implementation-log.md`: Added discovered implementations
- `path/to/drift-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md`: Detailed drift record

### Validation Needed
- Please review: `path/to/ambiguous-status.md` 
- Confirm completion: `path/to/partial-implementation.md`
- **Groom Integration**: Run `/groom` to see filtered backlog based on sync findings
```

## Detection Heuristics

### File Pattern Matching
```yaml
Feature Planning ‚Üí Implementation Patterns:
  API Endpoint:
    planned: "Create /api/users endpoint"
    evidence:
      - routes/**/users.{ts,js}
      - controllers/**/users.*
      - tests/**/*users*.test.*
      - middleware/auth* (if auth mentioned)
      
  Component:
    planned: "Build UserProfile component"  
    evidence:
      - components/**/UserProfile.*
      - components/**/user-profile.*
      - tests/**/UserProfile.test.*
      - styles/**/user-profile.*
      
  Service:
    planned: "Implement EmailService"
    evidence:
      - services/**/email*
      - services/**/Email*
      - config/*email*
      - tests/**/*email*.test.*
```

### Confidence Scoring
```
High Confidence (90%+):
- Main implementation file exists
- Test file exists with actual tests
- Referenced by other code
- Configuration entries present

Medium Confidence (60-89%):
- Main file exists but minimal
- Tests exist but incomplete
- Some configuration present
- No integration references

Low Confidence (30-59%):
- Only structure/stubs exist
- No tests found
- No configuration
- Could be coincidental naming
```

## Special Cases

### Handling Refactors
When implementation exists but doesn't match planned structure:
1. Check for moved/renamed files
2. Look for deprecation patterns
3. Scan for migration code
4. Check commit messages for "refactor"

### Handling Abandoned Work
When partial implementation is found but old:
1. Check last modified dates
2. Look for "WIP" or "TODO" comments
3. Check if superseded by other implementation
4. Look for blocking issues/dependencies

### Handling Experimental Code
When implementation exists in unexpected locations:
1. Check for "experimental" or "poc" directories
2. Look for feature flags
3. Check branch names (if accessible)
4. Look for duplicate implementations

## Sync Command Options

```bash
/sync                     # Full sync: detect completions + update task sources
/sync --last 7d          # Only check work from last 7 days  
/sync --project X        # Sync specific project area
/sync --confidence high  # Only apply high-confidence updates
/sync --dry-run         # Preview all changes (including task updates)
/sync --verbose         # Include detailed evidence
/sync --interactive     # Prompt for ambiguous cases
/sync --groom-prep      # Prepare sync-state.json for groom integration
/sync --no-task-updates # Skip file modifications, only update sync state
```

## Red Flags During Sync

1. **Large unexplained codebase changes** - May indicate undocumented major work
2. **Test files with no corresponding implementation** - May indicate deleted/moved code
3. **Commits mentioning "revert"** - Work may have been undone
4. **Multiple implementations of same feature** - May indicate coordination issues
5. **"HACK" or "FIXME" in new code** - May indicate rushed/incomplete implementation

## Post-Sync Actions

1. **Notify relevant agents/team members** of discovered completions
2. **Create follow-up tasks** for partial implementations
3. **Update project velocity metrics** based on actual completion
4. **Flag process improvements** based on drift patterns
5. **Schedule deep-dive review** for ambiguous cases

## Integration with Other Commands

### Enhanced Groom Integration (NEW)
- **Recommended workflow**: `/sync --groom-prep && /groom` for reality-based backlog
- Sync updates task sources before groom reads them
- Groom automatically filters out sync-confirmed completions
- Reduces grooming of already-complete work

### Traditional Integration
- Run `/sync` before any planning session
- Run `/sync` after any system crash or interruption  
- Run `/sync` when onboarding new team members
- Include `/sync --dry-run` in regular health checks
- Chain with audit command: `/sync && /audit`

### Sync-State Lifecycle
- Sync generates `context-network/meta/sync-state.json`
- Groom consumes sync state for reality-aware task filtering
- Sync state expires after 7 days (configurable)
- Conflicts in sync state require manual resolution before grooming
