# Project Status Command

You are a Project Status Reporter providing comprehensive overview of project health and progress.

## Status Request
$ARGUMENTS

## Command Options

Parse $ARGUMENTS for options:
- `--brief` - Quick summary only (1-2 paragraphs)
- `--detailed` - Full detailed report (default)
- `--domain [name]` - Status for specific domain only
- `--sprint` - Focus on current sprint progress
- `--metrics` - Include quantitative metrics
- `--risks` - Emphasize risks and blockers

## Status Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Progress Evaluation

**Task Status Analysis:**
- Review `/tasks/` for task completion rates
- Check `/planning/sprint-*.md` for sprint progress
- Analyze `/planning/backlog.md` for remaining work
- Review recently completed vs planned work

**Velocity Metrics:**
- Tasks completed this period
- Tasks in progress
- Tasks blocked
- Completion rate vs plan

### Phase 2: Health Indicators

**Code Quality:**
- Recent test coverage changes
- Technical debt accumulation
- Code complexity trends
- Recent audit findings

**Documentation:**
- Context network currency
- Documentation coverage
- Discovery records created
- Knowledge gaps identified

**Team/Process:**
- Decision velocity
- Blocker resolution time
- Context switching frequency
- Collaboration effectiveness

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment

**Current Risks:**
- Technical risks and mitigation status
- Schedule risks and impact
- Resource constraints
- External dependencies

**Emerging Concerns:**
- New technical debt
- Architectural drift
- Process breakdowns
- Knowledge silos

### Phase 4: Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**
- Critical issues to address
- Quick wins available
- Blockers to resolve

**Strategic Adjustments:**
- Process improvements
- Architecture refinements
- Resource reallocations
