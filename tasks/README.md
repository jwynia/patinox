# Task Management for Memory Management Utilities

This directory contains tasks deferred from the code review recommendations for the memory management utilities implementation.

## Task Categories

### üêõ Bugs (`/bugs/`)
Critical issues that could cause runtime failures or unexpected behavior.

- **replace-expect-calls-with-results.md** - HIGH PRIORITY
  - Replace panic-inducing expect() calls with safe Result types
  - Impact: Prevents production crashes
  - Effort: 2-4 hours

### ‚ö° Performance (`/performance/`)
Optimizations that improve system efficiency and resource utilization.

- **optimize-cleanup-task-polling.md** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
  - Replace timeout polling with select! for better efficiency
  - Impact: Reduced CPU usage, better responsiveness
  - Effort: 3-5 hours

### üîß Refactoring (`/refactoring/`)
Code organization and maintainability improvements.

- **improve-error-context-preservation.md** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
  - Better error chain preservation in CleanupError conversion
  - Impact: Improved debugging experience
  - Effort: 2-3 hours

- **refactor-cleanup-task-function.md** - LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY
  - Split large function into focused components
  - Impact: Better maintainability
  - Effort: 1-2 hours

### üí° Technical Debt (`/tech-debt/`)
Long-term improvements and monitoring enhancements.

- **add-drop-failure-monitoring.md** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
  - Add monitoring for Drop implementation failures
  - Impact: Better visibility into resource management
  - Effort: 2-4 hours

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate Next Sprint
1. **replace-expect-calls-with-results.md** - Critical for production safety
2. **improve-error-context-preservation.md** - Better debugging support

### Future Sprints
3. **optimize-cleanup-task-polling.md** - Performance improvement
4. **add-drop-failure-monitoring.md** - Observability enhancement
5. **refactor-cleanup-task-function.md** - Code quality

## Dependencies

- Tasks are mostly independent
- Error handling improvements should be coordinated
- Monitoring tasks depend on observability system design
- Performance tasks may require benchmarking infrastructure

## Success Metrics

- Zero production panics from resource management
- Improved error debugging experience
- Better system performance under load
- Enhanced observability into resource lifecycle
- Improved code maintainability scores
